For 6 years, I had been using python exclusively as the main tool for carrying out my data science tasks and running my experiments. Recently, I have started using Tidyverse packages and tools in R for my data science activities. I am completely facinated by how these tools make it easy for me to perform analysis and create nice visualization. Since then I have tried to participate in the weekly Tidy Tuesday project.
You can find my submissions in this page.
