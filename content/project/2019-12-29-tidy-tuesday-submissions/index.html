<p>For 6 years, I had been using python exclusively for my data science tasks and experiments. However, recently I have started using Tidyverse packages and tools in R for my data science activities. I am completely facinated by how these tools make it easy for me to perform analysis and create nice visualization. Since then I have tried to participate in the weekly Tidy Tuesday project.
