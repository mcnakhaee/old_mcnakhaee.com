Advantages
There are many ways to do one thing
The output is a table which you can use as an input to everything that works with a table


Disadvantages


##Classification Models




## Regression Models



### Making Prediction


### Model selection

reasonable defaults for tidymodel

tidymodel by default tuning paramters are set for us. We can also specify them ourselves.

you can even tune the preprocessing steps in Tidymodel.

## Pipelines
pipelines are handy: 
they make your code  much shorter
data leakage


## Pre-Processing
inverse transform

###

My preferable way


Automatic machine learning

parellal processing
