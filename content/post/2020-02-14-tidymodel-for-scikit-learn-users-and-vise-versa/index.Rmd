Advantages
There are many ways to do one thing
The output is a table which you can use as an input to everything that works with a table


Disadvantages


##Classification Models




## Regression Models



### Making Prediction


### Model selection

reasonable defaults for tidymodel

tidymodel by default tuning paramters are set for us. We can also specify them ourselves.

you can even tune the preprocessing steps in Tidymodel.

## Pipelines
pipelines are handy: 
they make your code  much shorter
data leakage


## Unsupervised Learning

### PCA

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ranking_rec <- recipe(points ~ ., data = ranking_df) %>%
  update_role(title, artist, new_role = "id") %>%
  step_log(points) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_pca(all_predictors())

tidied_pca <- tidy(ranking_prep, 3)

```


## Pre-Processing
inverse transform

###

My preferable way


Automatic machine learning

parellal processing
