## But why? An introduction to causal inference from empirical data**

1. what is causation?
2. how can we measure causation?
3. how can we discover causation? 

Causation is not correlation but what is it?

> The relationship between something that happens or exists and the things that cause it to happen or exist

Causal inference 

> The process of reasoning to the conclusion that something is or is ***likely***  to be, the cause of something else
