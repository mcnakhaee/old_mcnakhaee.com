## ***[Explanations in Philosophy and Psychology](https://euads.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Explanations-in-Philosophy-and-Psychology-2.pdf)\*: [Christos Bechlivanidis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/person/christos-bechlivanidis/),**



Explanations are always expressed in  a contrastive manner and this contrast is usually implied by the context.

1. ### Producers and consumers of explanations in AI



The developer who produces the explanation and evaluates it or as Miller et al (2017), the inmates are running the asylum phenomena.

But what makes the good explanation for the developer is not necessarily good for other users of the system.

The developer has a deeper understanding of the  system. However, his/her understanding, perspective, or goals may be different from the end-user. When producing explanations we need to carefully assess the complexity of the explanation and the knowledge and beliefs of the audience.

### What is an explanation?

Answering this question depends on who we ask. 

- > An explanations is not a description

Philosopher considers a (good) explanations to be scientific explanations

Psychologists : What do people consider an explanations and what makes a good explanations (e.g. everyday explanations)

## But why? An introduction to causal inference from empirical data**

1. what is causation?
2. how can we measure causation?
3. how can we discover causation? 

Causation is not correlation but what is it?

> The relationship between something that happens or exists and the things that cause it to happen or exist

Causal inference 

> The process of reasoning to the conclusion that something is or is ***likely***  to be, the cause of something else



**Explanations for a Psychological Perspective**

Explanations are always said in a contrastive manner depending on the context



Miller et al (2017): The inmates are running the asylum

Different types of explanation complexities for different audience:

Fred

Explanation is not a description

Psychologists care about the **descriptive** side: what do people see as an explanation & what properties do they value in an explanation compared to the **normative** view on explanations used by philosophers which focuses on answering the questions what is a (good) explanation

##### Different definition of explanations proposed by different philosophers over time 

• **Aristotle**: Citing the *function*, *the material*, *the category* or the (efficient) cause of X

•**Hempel**:  Producing an (logical) argument whose conclusion  is X (explanandum)
• **Salmon** Stating everything that affects the probability of X 
• Stating the causal history of X
• Showing how X fits a more general state of affairs

**TYPES OF EXPLANATIONS**

Why are we interested in explanations?

1. **To prepare ourselves for the futures events:** Why is the phone turned off? because it has low battery.
2. **Just to understand or assign blames in one-off events**: why did the assassination of Duke Ferdinand led to WWI?
3. **Rationalizing actions:**
4. **To find meaning** 
5. **To become satisfied from explanations**

People and children are often biased toward teleological explanations ( looking for the purpose not the cause): 

​	Mountains were created to be climbed.



**Properties of a good explanations**

1. No Circularity

2. Coherence :

   Different elements of explanation must  have internal consistency (i.e. with prior knowledge and current evidence)

   Explaining the full set of elements is not feasible (explaining how a bicycle works we need to say how its various mechanical elements interact and constrain each other)

   Explanations are incomplete (even in science) because our mental
   representations are skeletal and incomplete. We have an illusion that we deeply understand and we can explain things. 

   Tiger example: Tigers have dark vertical stripes on their bodies but without looking at an image of a tiger answer whether these stripes are  vertical or horizontal on the tiger's tail and legs.

   - How much do you know how a bicycle work?  Draw one!
   - One of the most important measure of explanation quality was “perceived expertise”, i.e. whether participants believed the explanation was written by an expert. (Zemla et al (2017))

3. Relevance:

   - From philosophical point of view,  only factors that make a difference to the explanandum should be included to generate a good explanation. 

   - But is it true for non-experts? Weisberg et al (2008) showed that adding irrelevant neuroscientific information (e.g. jargons) to an explanation increased its perceived quality for non-experts. 

   - Another experiment in which participant were asked to rate 3 types of explanations:

   - ![image-20191231205443309](C:\Users\iMuhammad\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20191231205443309.png)

   - The average ratings for the abstract explanation was significantly lower than the irrelevant explanation.

   - ![image-20191231210622105](C:\Users\iMuhammad\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20191231210622105.png)

   -  On the other hand, the causal ratings for the abstract explanation was higher that the other two types of explanations

4. Match the epistemic status of the audience:

   - When producing explanations we need to carefully assess
     the knowledge and beliefs of the audience

5. Simplicity 

   - What do we mean by simplicity? (number of entities,number of entity types, shortest description? )
   - Paul Thagard (1989): simplicity is determined by the number of special assumptions required.  People prefer these kinds of simpler explanations because fewer assumptions means fewer unexplained causes .
   - However when probabilities of are included in explanations, people choose the most probable explanation not the simplest.
   - In Zemla et al (2017) it was shown that  the quality of explanations was positively correlated both with the number of unexplained causes and its length (level of detail)

6. Generality (Breadth– Scope - Coverage)

EVALUATING EXPLANATIONS

Do the users think that an explanation is  good explanation

How well do they understand this explanation

![image-20200103185719893](C:\Users\iMuhammad\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200103185719893.png)

We need to compare different versions of our explanations (like A/B testing)

Different groups of users see different explanation and same group of users see different explanation.

To evaluate our explanations we have to ask a public audience. This audience can be our friends, family members and colleagues who may not have any knowledge of the system. However, we should take into account that the these evaluations can be biased and noisy. For this reason, we need to take a large sample.

Alternatively we can collaborate with HCI experts,  psychologist and behavioral scientist to evaluate explanations.

we can also utilize online crowdsourcing tools and run our analysis through them:

•Amazon Mechanical Turk – mturk.com
• Prolific Academic - prolific.co
• Gorilla - gorilla.sc
• Testable - testable.org
