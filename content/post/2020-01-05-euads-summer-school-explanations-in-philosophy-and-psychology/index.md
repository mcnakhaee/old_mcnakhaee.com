1. ### Producers and consumers of explanations in AI

The developer who produces the explanation and evaluates it or as Miller et al (2017), the inmates are running the asylum phenomena.

But what makes the good explanation for the developer is not necessarily good for other users of the system.

The developer has a deeper understanding of the  system. However, his/her understanding, perspective, or goals may be different from the end-user. When producing explanations we need to carefully assess the complexity of the explanation and the knowledge and beliefs of the audience. Fred does not know anything about how neural networks work.

### What is an explanation?

Explanations are always expressed in  a contrastive manner and this contrast is usually implied by the context. Also, an explanations is not a description. 

Nevertheless, answering "what is an explanation? " depends on who we ask. 

Philosopher care about the **normative** side of an explanation and consider a (good) explanations to be a scientific explanation. But psychologists are interested in the **descriptive** side or what people consider as an explanation such as everyday explanations and what makes a good explanation.

Different philosophers and scientists have proposed different definition for an explanation:

• **Aristotle**: Citing the *function*, *the material*, *the category* or the (efficient) cause of X. 

•**Hempel**:  Producing an (logical) argument whose conclusion is the explanandum X. 
• **Salmon**: Stating everything that affects the probability of X. In other words, If P(Β|Α) ≠ P(Β) then A is explanatory relevant to B (e.g. P(pregnant | male & contraceptives) = P(pregnant | male)). One downside of this definition is that A does not need to have a high probability to be explanatory. For example,if P(Β|Α) - P(Β) = 0.000001, A is still explanatory  relevant to B.
**Salmon:** Stating the causal history of X. An explanation of X will trace the causal processes and interactions that lead to X, thus
showing how X fits into a causal nexus. But, in general, not all causal events in the past of X are
explanatory relevant to X. The causal model  presented by Salmon has limitation in dealing with certain type of causation such as Double Prevention.

Imagine the above image where a pink plane wants to drop a bomb on a city. A red plane with an alligator has a mission to shoot the pink plane and prevent the bombing. Also, A blue plane is there to prevent the red plane from shooting the pink plane. Now if the the  blue plane successfully shoot the red plane and the pink plane successfully drops its bomb on the city, does the blue plane cause the bombardment of the city.

**Kitcher**:• Showing how X fits a more general state of affairs

### **TYPES OF EXPLANATIONS**

### Why are we interested in explanations?

We seek explanations because:

1. **To prepare ourselves for similar events in the future :** Why is the phone turned off? because it has low battery.
2. **Just to explain, understand and assign responsibilities or blames in one-off events**: why did the assassination of Duke Ferdinand lead to WWI?
3. **To rationalize actions that we take:** Why didn't you vote?  Because it does not make any difference
4. **To find meaning** 
5. **To become satisfied from explanations**. The explanations are like orgasms.

Nevertheless, the explanations may not fulfill their    function or objective.

#### **A PREFERENCE FOR TELEOLOGY**

However, some people and children are often biased toward teleological explanations and they are looking for the purpose not the cause in their explanations:  Mountains were created to be climbed.

### Explanations virtues 

The following properties have been proposed as criteria of a good explanation:

1. **No Circularity**: "This diet pill works because it helps people lose weight" and "People lose weight because they use  this diet pill" are circular arguments. Although we can detect circularity from childhood, it is not always easy to identify it.

2. **Coherence** : Different elements of explanation must have internal consistency. It means that an explanation must be consistent with prior knowledge and current evidence.

   However, explaining the full set of elements (relations) may not be simple. For instance, to fully explain how a bicycle works we need to say how its various mechanical elements interact and constrain each other.

   Explanations are incomplete (even in science) because our mental representations are skeletal and incomplete. We tend to overestimate the depth of our own
   understanding. But the moment we start writing down our understanding, it becomes clear that our understanding is (mostly) shallow and incomplete. 

   **Tiger example**: Tigers have dark vertical stripes on their bodies but  can we tell without looking at an image of a tiger whether these stripes are vertical or horizontal on the tiger's tail and legs?!

   **Bicycle example**: How much do you know how a bicycle work?  Draw one!

   But sometimes compression is also needed.

   - We rely heavily in expertise of other minds. In an experiment carried out by Zemla et al. (2017), it was observed that compared to other measures such as complexity, articulation, coherence, generality and truth, one of the most important measures of explanation quality for the participants was “perceived expertise”.  Perceived expertise indicates whether participants believed the explanation was written by an expert. The more we we trust in the expertise of the explainer, the more likely we accept the explanation.

3. **Relevance**:

   - From philosophical point of view,  only factors that make a difference to the explanandum or have a causal role should be included to generate a good explanation.  This level of details is ideal but not attainable and we usually find a trade-off by abstraction. Moreover, hyper-concrete explanations are too true  to be good.

   - But is it true for non-experts? Weisberg et al (2008) showed that adding irrelevant neuroscientific information (e.g. jargons) to an explanation increased its perceived quality for non-experts. 

   - Another experiment  was carried out in which participant were asked to rate 3 types of explanations:

   - ![image-20191231205443309](C:\Users\iMuhammad\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20191231205443309.png)

     ![image-20191231205847288](C:\Users\iMuhammad\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20191231205847288.png)

   - The average ratings for the abstract explanation was significantly lower than the irrelevant explanation.

   - ![image-20191231210622105](C:\Users\iMuhammad\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20191231210622105.png)

   -  On the other hand, the causal ratings for the abstract explanation was higher that the other two types of explanations

4. Match the epistemic status of the audience:

   - When producing explanations we need to carefully assess
     the knowledge and beliefs of the audience

5. Simplicity 

   - What do we mean by simplicity? (number of entities,number of entity types, shortest description? )
   - Paul Thagard (1989): simplicity is determined by the number of special assumptions required.  People prefer these kinds of simpler explanations because fewer assumptions means fewer unexplained causes .
   - However when probabilities of are included in explanations, people choose the most probable explanation not the simplest.
   - In Zemla et al (2017) it was shown that  the quality of explanations was positively correlated both with the number of unexplained causes and its length (level of detail)

6. Generality (Breadth– Scope - Coverage)

EVALUATING EXPLANATIONS

Do the users think that an explanation is  good explanation

How well do they understand this explanation

![image-20200103185719893](C:\Users\iMuhammad\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200103185719893.png)

We need to compare different versions of our explanations (like A/B testing)

Different groups of users see different explanation and same group of users see different explanation.

To evaluate our explanations we have to ask a public audience. This audience can be our friends, family members and colleagues who may not have any knowledge of the system. However, we should take into account that the these evaluations can be biased and noisy. For this reason, we need to take a large sample.

Alternatively we can collaborate with HCI experts,  psychologist and behavioral scientist to evaluate explanations.

we can also utilize online crowdsourcing tools and run our analysis through them:

•Amazon Mechanical Turk – mturk.com
• Prolific Academic - prolific.co
• Gorilla - gorilla.sc
• Testable - testable.org

Experiment





## But why? An introduction to causal inference from empirical data**

1. what is causation?
2. how can we measure causation?
3. how can we discover causation? 

Causation is not correlation but what is it?

> The relationship between something that happens or exists and the things that cause it to happen or exist

Causal inference 

> The process of reasoning to the conclusion that something is or is ***likely***  to be, the cause of something else
