However, explainablity is not an entirely new concept and it was actually started a few decades ago. In this blogpost, I will introduce you to a rather unknown but simple technique which was introduced almost 20 years ago. This technique is called Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) for explaining ML models and show you how we can explain any types of machine learning.\nWhat Kinds of explanation does CIU generate?\rIt is a model-agnostic methods and it can explain the output of any “black-box” machine learning model.\rIt produces local explanations which means that the explanations are generated for individual instances (not the whole model) and they just show which features are more important with respect to an individual observation.\rIt gives us post-hoc explanations as it is a method that processes the output of a machine learning model after training.\r\rUnlike LIME and many other techniques, CIU does not approximate or transforms what a model predicts but rather directly explain predictions. It can also provide a contrastive explanation. For instance, why did the model predict rainy and not cloudy?\n\rHow does CIIU work?\rCIT estimates two values that aim to explain the context in which a machine learning model predicts:\nContextual Importance (CI) is a measure of how much of change in the range an output values can be attributed to one (or several) input variables. CU is based on the notion that a variable which results in a wider ranger of output values would be more important. Formally, CIU is defined as follows:\nCI = (Cmax - Cmin)/(absmax - absmin)\nContextual Utility (CU) indicates how favorable the current value of one (or several) input variables is for a high output value. CU is computed using the following formula.\nCU = (out - Cmin)/(Cmax - Cmin)\nCmax and Cmin are the highest and lowest values that the output of an ML model can take by changing the input feature(s). Obtaining Cmax and Cmin is computationally and mathematically is not a trivial task. Also, absmax and absmin indicate the absolute range of values that the output has taken. For example, In classification problems, the absolute minimum and maximum range of values are the predicted probabilities of machine learning models and are between 0 and 1.\nCIU is implemented both in python and R. For simplicity, I will use its python implementation (py-ciu library) in this blogpost.\nYou can install py-ciu using the pip command:\npip install py-ciu\r\rA toy example: predicting breast\rI will use breast cancer dataset in scikit-learn to show how we can use CIU. I will train three different machine learning models including a decision tree, a random forest and a gradient boosting algorithm on this dataset and compute CI and CU values for a single instance from test dataset.\nFirst we need to load necessary libraries and modules.\nfrom ciu import determine_ciu\rfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier,RandomForestClassifier\rfrom sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance\rfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\rfrom sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer\rfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\rimport pandas as pd\rimport numpy as np\rimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r# for reproducability\rnp.random.seed(123)\rThen we split the dataset into a training and test set. We train our machine learning models on the training dataset and evaluate their performance on the test dataset. Note that for explaining ML models, we also use samples from the test dataset and not the training dataset.\nX = pd.DataFrame(load_breast_cancer()[\u0026#39;data\u0026#39;])\ry = load_breast_cancer()[\u0026#39;target\u0026#39;]\rX.columns = load_breast_cancer()[\u0026#39;feature_names\u0026#39;]\rX_train,X_test, y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,stratify = y)\rdef fit_evaluate_model(clf):\rclf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\rprint(\u0026#39; Accuracy on test dataset {}\u0026#39;.format(clf.score(X_test,y_test)))\rreturn clf\rPermutation feature importance\rAs I mentioned before, CIU only generates local explanations and doesn’t give us an global overview of how a model makes prediction.

Introduction\rIt wasn’t possible for many of us to watch every 2020 Democratic Primary debate. It was important for some of us to know what happened during the debates. In my case, I was reading about what happened in debates in some kind of online newspapers or I watched a highlight of a debate on Youtube the next day. However, they only give a short summary of a debate or just broadcast a portion of debates that includes a heated exchange of opinions between candidates. As a result, many important issues raised by candidates will be ignored and forgotten in the aftermath of a debate. So, it is important to summarize the content of a debate in such a way that everyone could understand what went on in a debate and what issues each candidate addressed during his/her speech. In this blog post, I will show you how I used some NLP techniques for exploring the content of debates and give you a comprehensive overview of topics that each candidate discussed.\nIn my last blog post, I explained that I had the three following goals in mind when I started exploring the 2020 Democratic Debates :\nTo know how eloquent presidential candidate are.\rTo find out who used more positive or more negative words in his/her speech by performing sentiment analysis.\rA map of topics, individuals and entities that each candidate mentioned in his/her speech by using named entity recognition and network analysis..\r\rI only discussed how I approached the first two aspects of my experiment in my last blogpost. Now it is time to investigate the third and last one.\nInitially, my aim from using network analysis was to determine potential allies and enemies on the debate stage. For example, Elizabeth Warren mentioned Mike Bloomberg several times and attacked him harshly in the 9th debate. During the same debate, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg clashed bitterly with each other. These are just two instances of many other heated exchanges between the candidates that happend over the course of 10 debates.\n\rTo make things more clear, I transformed my objective into two questions that I would like to answer:\n\r\rHow many times did a candidate address (mention) other candidates during a debate?\rHow did he/she refer to a candidate(in a friendly or unfriendly manner)?\r\r\rA simple approach to answer these questions is to store the names of all candidates in a variable (for example a vector in R or a list in Python), iterate over the transcript, compute the sentiment, count and store the number of times that a candidate’s name was brought up by another candidate.\nHowever, this approach is a little bit challenging and requires a lot of manual data pre-processing efforts. For each democratic candidate, one must compile a comprehensive combinations of ways that may be used to call a candidate and preparing such a list seems to be a very time-consuming task. For example, other candidates mentioned Bernie Sanders in many different ways including Bernie, Bernie Sanders or Senator Sanders.\nI realized that I can use Named Entity Recognition (NER), a technique from Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature, to extract the name of candidates from the transcript and solve this problem more efficiently. By using this approach, not only I can find candidates’ names form the transcript, but I can also find the names of other politicians, individuals and even organizations and further extend my analysis to include much more topics and issues.\n\r2. Workflow\rI made use of both python and R in my analysis. My workflow includes the following steps:\nI access the transcript of debates using this package.\rI use tidytext to split the transcript into multiple sentences and also for sentiment analysis.\rI extract several types of Named Entities from each sentence, using Spacy,\rI compute the sentiment of each sentence using TextBlob library in Python.\rI transferred the results to R for visualization. There, I visualize the network of mentions and entities using ggraph and ggplot library.\r\rNote that I could have implemented all the steps in R. For instance, Spacy has an R wrapper called Spacyr which gives the same functionality that I need for this analysis. However, I’d like to increase the number of tools that I can use. Particularly, using Python and R side by side is an interesting challenge for me.\nlibrary(demdebates2020)\rlibrary(tidytext)\rlibrary(tidygraph)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(ggraph)\rlibrary(gghighlight)\rlibrary(ggthemes)\rlibrary(kableExtra)\rlibrary(reticulate)\rlibrary(magrittr)\rlibrary(pluralize)\rtheme_set(\rtheme_graph(base_family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;) +\rtheme(\rpanel.border = element_blank(),\rplot.title = element_text(\rfamily = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;,\rface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,\rcolour = \u0026#39;#540b0e\u0026#39;,\rsize = 42,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(40, 40, 20, 10),\rhjust = 0\r),\rplot.subtitle = element_text(\rfamily = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;,\rface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,\rcolour = \u0026#39;#7d4f50\u0026#39;,\rsize = 30,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(20, 40, 80, 10),\rhjust = 0\r),\rplot.caption = element_text(\rfamily = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;,\rface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,\rcolour = \u0026#39;#540b0e\u0026#39;,\rsize = 16,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(0, 0, 20, 20),\r),\rlegend.position = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;,\rplot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026#39;#FCF0E1\u0026#39;),\r)\r)\r2.2 Loading the dataset\rhead(debates) \r\r\rspeaker\r\rbackground\r\rspeech\r\rtype\r\rgender\r\rdebate\r\rday\r\rorder\r\r\r\r\r\rSavannah Guthrie\r\rNA\r\rAll right.

Tokenization\rAs I mentioned before, I use tidytext to tokenize the transcript dataset based on sentences. For sentence tokenization, you need to set token = 'sentences' in unnest_tokens() function. I think sentence tokenization is a reasonable choice because candidates might change the subject or the tone of their speech in each sentence.\ndebates \u0026lt;- debates %\u0026gt;%\runnest_tokens(sentence, speech, token = \u0026#39;sentences\u0026#39;,to_lower = FALSE)\rhead(debates) \rhead(debates) %\u0026gt;%\rkable() %\u0026gt;%\rkable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\u0026quot;striped\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hover\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;condensed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;responsive\u0026quot;))\r\r\rspeaker\r\rbackground\r\rtype\r\rgender\r\rdebate\r\rday\r\rorder\r\rsentence\r\r\r\r\r\rAbby Phillip\r\r(APPLAUSE)\r\rModerator\r\rfemale\r\r7\r\r1\r\r222\r\rNA\r\r\r\rAbby Phillip\r\r(APPLAUSE)\r\rModerator\r\rfemale\r\r7\r\r1\r\r283\r\rNA\r\r\r\rAbby Phillip\r\r(APPLAUSE)\r\rModerator\r\rfemale\r\r7\r\r1\r\r285\r\rNA\r\r\r\rAbby Phillip\r\r(APPLAUSE)\r\rModerator\r\rfemale\r\r7\r\r1\r\r328\r\rNA\r\r\r\rAbby Phillip\r\r(APPLAUSE)\r\rModerator\r\rfemale\r\r7\r\r1\r\r576\r\rNA\r\r\r\rAbby Phillip\r\r(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\r\rModerator\r\rfemale\r\r7\r\r1\r\r284\r\rNA\r\r\r\r\r\r3. Named Entity Recognition using Spacy\rNow we change to python for NER but before starting the analysis, we need to install and import a few python libraries.\nimport pandas as pd\rimport spacy\rfrom textblob import TextBlob\rIn RStudio and Rmarkdown notebooks, with the help of reticulate library, we can easily load the debate dataset in our R environment to our Python environment, .\ndebates = r.debates\rNote that in in the transcript dataset there are rows for both the candidates and the moderators who asked questions from candidates. However, we are particularly interested in what the candidates said, so we only filter rows corresponding to candidates.\ncandidates = debates[(debates[\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;] == \u0026#39;Candidate\u0026#39;) \u0026amp; (pd.notnull(debates[\u0026#39;sentence\u0026#39;])) ]\rWe are almost ready for extracting the named entities. But to use Spacy’s NLP features such as NER, we first need to download and load a pre-trained English language model. There are several English language models with different sizes available in Spacy. I used the largest language model available as it might be better and more accurate.\nnlp = spacy.load(\u0026#39;en_core_web_lg\u0026#39;)\rSpacy’s NER model is trained on the OntoNotes 5 corpus and it can detect several types of named entities including:\n\r\rTYPE\rDESCRIPTION\r\r\r\rPERSON\rPeople, including fictional.\r\rNORP\rNationalities or religious or political groups.\r\rFAC\rBuildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc.\r\rORG\rCompanies, agencies, institutions, etc.\r\rGPE\rCountries, cities, states.\r\rLOC\rNon-GPE locations, mountain ranges, bodies of water.\r\rPRODUCT\rObjects, vehicles, foods, etc. (Not services.)\r\rEVENT\rNamed hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc.\r\rWORK_OF_ART\rTitles of books, songs, etc.\r\rLAW\rNamed documents made into laws.\r\rLANGUAGE\rAny named language.\r\rDATE\rAbsolute or relative dates or periods.\r\rTIME\rTimes smaller than a day.\r\rPERCENT\rPercentage, including ”%“.\r\rMONEY\rMonetary values, including unit.\r\rQUANTITY\rMeasurements, as of weight or distance.\r\rORDINAL\r“first”, “second”, etc.\r\rCARDINAL\rNumerals that do not fall under another type.\r\r\r\rAs you can see, there are many types of named entities but I narrow down my analysis to just a handful of them including PERSON, ORG, GPE, NORP, LAW and LOC.\rThe named entity labels are stored in label_ attribute. To do so, we need to create Doc object using nlp() method. When we call nlp() on the input text, spacy uses the language model to tokenize the document first. Then, spacy applies a tagger, parser and named entity recognizer steps as the next components of its processing pipeline. The named entities can be accessed by ents attribute of the document object.\nIf you are interested to learn more about Spacy and how it works, I have provided some links at the end of this post.\nI define a python function that iterates over all named entities and see to which class of named entities (by default PERSON) they belong. I apply this function to the transcript column in the original dataset and store each extracted type of entities as a separate column.\ndef extract_entities_delim(text,type_ent = \u0026#39;PERSON\u0026#39;):\rent_text = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\rdoc = nlp(text)\rfor e in doc.ents:\rif e.label_ == type_ent:\rent_text = e.text+ \u0026#39;;\u0026#39; + ent_text return ent_text\rcandidates[\u0026#39;PERSON\u0026#39;] = candidates[\u0026#39;sentence\u0026#39;].apply(lambda x:extract_entities_delim(x))\rcandidates[\u0026#39;ORG\u0026#39;] = candidates[\u0026#39;sentence\u0026#39;].apply(lambda x:extract_entities_delim(x,\u0026#39;ORG\u0026#39;))\rcandidates[\u0026#39;GPE\u0026#39;] = candidates[\u0026#39;sentence\u0026#39;].apply(lambda x:extract_entities_delim(x,\u0026#39;GPE\u0026#39;))\rcandidates[\u0026#39;NORP\u0026#39;] = candidates[\u0026#39;sentence\u0026#39;].apply(lambda x:extract_entities_delim(x,\u0026#39;NORP\u0026#39;))\rcandidates[\u0026#39;LAW\u0026#39;] = candidates[\u0026#39;sentence\u0026#39;].apply(lambda x:extract_entities_delim(x,\u0026#39;LAW\u0026#39;))\rcandidates[\u0026#39;LOC\u0026#39;] = candidates[\u0026#39;sentence\u0026#39;].apply(lambda x:extract_entities_delim(x,\u0026#39;LOC\u0026#39;))\r\r4. Sentiment Analysis\rNext, I use TextBlob to compute the sentiment of each sentence and store store its polarity score in a separate column called polarity_sentiment (TextBlob also returns a subjectivity score but for simplicity, I will not use this score in my analysis). The polarity sentiment score is a value between -1 and 1. If the value is larger than 0, it means that the sentence has a positive sentiment. On the other hand, if the returned value is smaller than 0, it indicates that the sentiment of the sentence is negative.\ndef polarity_sentiment(text):\rblob = TextBlob(text)\rreturn blob.sentiment.polarity\rcandidates[\u0026#39;polarity_sentiment\u0026#39;] = candidates.sentence.apply(lambda x:polarity_sentiment(x))\r\r\r5.Network Visualization\rA network (graph) can nicely represent how individuals and entities were mentioned by candidates in their speeches. We have two types of nodes in this network:\nThe first set of nodes represent candidates on the debate stage (from nodes).\rThe second set of nodes represent named entities (including the name of candidates themselves) that the candidates referred to in their speeches (to nodes).\r\rIf a candidate mentions a named entity in his/her speech, we connect the candidate node and the named entity node via an edge in our network. Also, It is fair to assume that the candidate-entity network should be a weighted network because candidates tend to place a varying level of importance on different issues, topics and people (named entities).\nWe have two options for specifying weights for edges in the network:\nWe can use the number of times that a candidate mentioned a named entity in his/her speech. This shows how much a named entity was important to that candidate.\rWe can group by candidates and named entities and compute their average sentiment score. By doing so, we can measure how each candidate described these named entities. However, this approach might not be as accurate as we want.\r\rHaving said that, it is time to go back to R and visualize the network of candidates and named entities using the ggraph and tidygraph libraries. For each class of named entities, I use as_tbl_graph() function and create a unique graph table dataset, and visualize the network.\nSo, let’s load the sentiment-entity dataset that I created in the Python environment to the R environment.\ncandidates \u0026lt;- py$candidates\rhead(candidates) \r\r\rX1\r\rspeaker\r\rbackground\r\rtype\r\rgender\r\rdebate\r\rday\r\rorder\r\rsentence\r\rPERSON\r\rORG\r\rGPE\r\rNORP\r\rLAW\r\rLOC\r\rpolarity_sentiment\r\r\r\r\r\r370\r\rAmy Klobuchar\r\rNA\r\rCandidate\r\rfemale\r\r1\r\r1\r\r11\r\rWell, first, the economy.\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r0.250\r\r\r\r371\r\rAmy Klobuchar\r\rNA\r\rCandidate\r\rfemale\r\r1\r\r1\r\r11\r\rWe know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity.\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r0.000\r\r\r\r372\r\rAmy Klobuchar\r\rNA\r\rCandidate\r\rfemale\r\r1\r\r1\r\r11\r\rAnd Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.\r\rDonald Trump;\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r0.025\r\r\r\r373\r\rAmy Klobuchar\r\rNA\r\rCandidate\r\rfemale\r\r1\r\r1\r\r12\r\rSo I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids.\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r0.375\r\r\r\r374\r\rAmy Klobuchar\r\rNA\r\rCandidate\r\rfemale\r\r1\r\r1\r\r12\r\rI do.\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r0.000\r\r\r\r375\r\rAmy Klobuchar\r\rNA\r\rCandidate\r\rfemale\r\r1\r\r1\r\r12\r\rBut I think my plan is a good one.\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\rNA\r\r0.700\r\r\r\r\r5.1 The Candidate/Person Network\rFirst, I will visualize the candidate/person network. However, I should remind you of the fact that in the beginning of the democratic primary many democratic candidates were competing against each other in the race and also on the debate stage. If I were to visualize every individual that each candidate had ever in the network, the results would become unreadable. So, just like my last blog post, I selected a few democratic candidates to show my analysis.\nFurthermore, I will only highlight nodes corresponding to the top 6 democratic candidates and other interesting individuals including Donald Trump and Barack Obama.\ninteresting_individuals \u0026lt;-\rc(\r\u0026quot;Bernie Sanders\u0026quot; ,\r\u0026quot;Elizabeth Warren\u0026quot; ,\r\u0026quot;Mike Bloomberg\u0026quot; ,\r\u0026quot;Pete Buttigieg\u0026quot; ,\r\u0026quot;Amy Klobuchar\u0026quot; ,\r\u0026quot;Joe Biden\u0026quot;,\r\u0026#39;Donald Trump\u0026#39;,\r\u0026#39;Barack Obama\u0026#39;\r)\rcustom_palette \u0026lt;-\rc(\r\u0026#39;Mike Bloomberg\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#EDC948\u0026#39;,\r\u0026#39;Amy Klobuchar\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#59A14F\u0026#39; ,\r\u0026#39;Joe Biden\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#E15759\u0026#39;,\r\u0026#39;Pete Buttigieg\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#B07AA1\u0026#39;,\r\u0026#39;Elizabeth Warren\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#F28E2B\u0026#39;,\r\u0026#39;Bernie Sanders\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#4E79A7\u0026#39; ,\r\u0026#39;Donald Trump\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#BC3908\u0026#39;,\r\u0026#39;Barack Obama\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#00afb9\u0026#39;,\r\u0026#39;Others\u0026#39; = \u0026#39;#540b0e\u0026#39;\r)\rpersons_graph_table \u0026lt;- candidates %\u0026gt;%\rseparate_rows(PERSON, sep = \u0026#39;;\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(speaker %in% interesting_individuals,PERSON != \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, debate %in% c(8, 9, 10)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(from = speaker, to = PERSON) %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(from, to) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize(n_mentions = n(),\rmean_sent = mean(polarity_sentiment),\rsent =case_when(mean_sent \u0026lt; -0.01 ~ \u0026#39;Negative\u0026#39;,\rmean_sent \u0026gt; 0.01 ~ \u0026#39;Positive\u0026#39;,\rTRUE ~ \u0026#39;Neutral\u0026#39; )\r) %\u0026gt;%\rungroup() %\u0026gt;%\ras_tbl_graph() %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(interesting_individuals = if_else(name %in% interesting_individuals, name, \u0026#39;Others\u0026#39;))\redge_cols \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;#e63946\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;#f1faee\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;#457B9D\u0026#39;)\rggraph(persons_graph_table, layout = \u0026#39;kk\u0026#39;) + geom_edge_link(aes(edge_width = n_mentions,colour = sent )) +\rgeom_node_point(aes(color = interesting_individuals ),size = 5) + geom_node_label(aes(label = name,color = interesting_individuals),repel = TRUE,size= 8) + scale_color_manual(values = custom_palette) +\rlabs(title = \u0026#39;Who Mentioned Whom in the 2020 Democratic Debates?\u0026#39;) +\rscale_edge_colour_manual(values = edge_cols) \rIf you look at the graph carefully, you will notice that there are three issues with this network. First of all, the sentiment scores does not necessarily indicate how a candidate thinks about that person. For instance, the edge between Bernie Sanders and Khashoggi is red (i.e. negative sentiment) but Bernie Sanders did not talk negatively about Khashoggi at all but rather how he was murdered. Secondly, there are several nodes in the network that belong to the same individual. For example, Bernie Sanders tends to address other candidates by their first names, but other (younger) candidates usually use the last name to address each other.\nThe third issue is that some nodes do not represent a person. The transcript dataset is full of errors and many names are misspelled. Also, although Spacy is a very powerful library for NER, sometimes it gives us wrong results and its detected named entities are not always correct. For this reason, we also need to perform a post-processing step in which we remove some incorrectly spelled words or replaced them with their correct forms. I found two ways to deal with these issues: 1. or we can use a name matching algorithm to match the partial names of a person with its full name. This approach can be a bit challenging because we need to have a list of all possible full names, which is only available for the candidates.2. we can manually find undesirable names and replace them with what we want.\n\r5.1 Matching candidate names\rThere is a python library called fuzzywuzzy that can help us match two strings based on different similarity criteria. However, before using this library, I transform the original dataset into a longer dataset where each row belongs to a pair of candidate-person (from-to) and I move it back to our python environment.\ncandidates_long \u0026lt;- candidates %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(PERSON != \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;%\rseparate_rows(PERSON, sep = \u0026#39;;\u0026#39;) head(candidates_long)\r\r\rA tibble: 6 x 16\rX1 speaker background type gender debate day order sentence PERSON ORG\n          \r1 372 Amy Kl~ NA Cand~ female 1 1 11 And Don~ “Dona~ \r2 372 Amy Kl~ NA Cand~ female 1 1 11 And Don~”\" \r3 384 Amy Kl~ NA Cand~ female 1 1 99 It’s so~ “Bara~ \r4 384 Amy Kl~ NA Cand~ female 1 1 99 It’s so~”\" \r5 422 Amy Kl~ NA Cand~ female 1 1 329 But the~ “Dona~ \r6 422 Amy Kl~ NA Cand~ female 1 1 329 But the~”\" \r# … with 5 more variables: GPE , NORP , LAW , LOC ,\r# polarity_sentiment \ncandidates_long = r.candidates_long\rLet’s look at the full names of democratic candidates.\nimport pandas as pd\rcandidate_lists = pd.unique(candidates_long.speaker)\rprint(candidate_lists)\r## [\u0026#39;Amy Klobuchar\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Andrew Yang\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Bernie Sanders\u0026#39; \u0026quot;Beto O\u0026#39;Rourke\u0026quot;\r## \u0026#39;Bill de Blasio\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Cory Booker\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Elizabeth Warren\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Eric Swalwell\u0026#39;\r## \u0026#39;Jay Inslee\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Joe Biden\u0026#39; \u0026#39;John Delaney\u0026#39; \u0026#39;John Hickenlooper\u0026#39;\r## \u0026#39;Julian Castro\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Kamala Harris\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Kirsten Gillibrand\u0026#39;\r## \u0026#39;Marianne Williamson\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Michael Bennet\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Mike Bloomberg\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Pete Buttigieg\u0026#39;\r## \u0026#39;Steve Bullock\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Tim Ryan\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Tom Steyer\u0026#39; \u0026#39;Tulsi Gabbard\u0026#39;]\rI define a python function called match_names which uses process.extractOne function to select the first matched named entity that has at least 80 percent similarity to a candidate’s full name.

The outcome of the election plays an important role in my life and almost everyone’s else around the world. So, I have been following the US politics for a few years.\nI consider everything and every issue around me as a data science problem and an opportunity to use data science. The US presidential election is not an exception, and a few weeks ago, I was wondering how I can use data science techniques to analyze the presidential election in the U.S and the Democratic Primary elections. Luckily, a few days later, I found an amazing R package on Twitter which contains the transcripts of speeches given by all candidates in the Democratic Party’s debates.\nNow that I had access to a dataset, it was time to think about how I should use it and how I can extract useful knowledge from it. There are many possibilities for studying the debates’ transcript, but I was interested in investigating 3 aspects of the debates and candidates:\nDetermining the most eloquent presidential candidate.\rSentiment analysis of the transcripts to find out who used positive or most negative words on the stage.\rNetwork analysis of the transcripts.\r\rIn this post, I will explain how I used R and the tidytext package to investigate the first two points. Discussing how I approached needs a much longer and separate post, so I will write about here.\nWho is the most eloquent candidate?\rEveryone agrees that Donald Trump only uses a basic English vocabulary in his speeches and tweets, and he is not the most eloquent president in the US history. But what about his future challenger from the democratic party and how skillful his opponents are with words? For this reason, I analyzed the transcripts from this point of view to determine how good they are with words.\nAn eloquent person has gained a rich vocabulary and uses a wide range of complex words in his/her speeches. An inarticulate person has a limited vocabulary and uses simple and everyday words in his/her writings or conversations. Ideally, I think we can measure eloquence by counting the number of unique words and the number of sophisticated words that a person uses.\nHowever, I could not find a dataset of English words along with their perceived complexity. So, to measure the eloquence of the presidential candidates, I defined two other metrics that I hope can serve as an approximation to the truth:\nVocabulary size: The ratio of unique words that a candidate used in his/her debate speech.\rVocabulary complexity: The ratio of stop-words (words that are very common and rarely add much value to the content). Intuitively, a lower ratio of stopword usage by a candidate shows that the candidate is more articulate.\r\rI use the Tidytext library and its stopword list to compute my defined metrics. Note that there are several stopword lexicons out there, and the choice of lexicon can slightly change the outcome.\nIt’s time to start the analysis itself, but before that I need to import a few libraries and set and customize the theme that I am going to use for visualization.\nlibrary(demdebates2020)\rlibrary(tidytext)\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(gghighlight)\rlibrary(ggthemes)\rlibrary(kableExtra)\r#set a default theme for visualization\rtheme_set(theme_fivethirtyeight())\r#customize the default theme theme_update(legend.position = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;,\rtext = element_text(family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;),\rplot.title = element_text(family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,size = 25, margin = margin(0, 0, 20, 0)),\raxis.text.x = element_blank(),\raxis.text.y = element_text(family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,size = 15, margin = margin(0, 0, 20, 0)),\rpanel.spacing = unit(2, \u0026quot;points\u0026quot;),\raxis.title.x = element_blank(),\raxis.title.y = element_blank())\rThe field of the democratic primary election is full of candidates. So, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, I am going to analyze candidates that are still in the race (as of February 23rd) and were present in the last two democratic debate. It means that I will compare six democratic candidates including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden.\nspeakers \u0026lt;- debates %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(!is.na(speech), type == \u0026#39;Candidate\u0026#39; ,debate == 9) %\u0026gt;%\rdistinct(speaker) %\u0026gt;%\rpull(speaker)\rspeakers\r## [1] \u0026quot;Bernie Sanders\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Elizabeth Warren\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Mike Bloomberg\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Pete Buttigieg\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;Amy Klobuchar\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Joe Biden\u0026quot;\rBefore computing my desirable metrics, I should tokenize and transform the transcript into a tidy format (one word per row).

On the other hand, Mike Bloomberg had used the largest ratio of stopwords in his first and only debates so far.\n\rVocabulary size\rThe vocabulary size metric shows a different trend as Mike Bloomberg has the highest score among the rest of the candidates. Of course and as I mentioned before, Bloomberg has appeared only once on the debate stage, and it might be too soon to draw a conclusion about his eloquence.\n debate_vocab_df %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(speaker = fct_reorder(speaker,vocab_size,.desc = FALSE)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = speaker , y = vocab_size,fill = speaker)) +\rgeom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\rgeom_label(aes(label = round(vocab_size,digits = 3) ,size = 8)) +\rcoord_flip() +\rscale_fill_manual(values = custom_palette) +\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;The ratio of unique Words used by Democratic candidates in the Debates\u0026quot;,\rcaption = \u0026#39;Visualization: @m_cnakhaee\\n\\n Source: https://github.com/favstats/demdebates2020\u0026#39;)\rSo, there is no outright winner in terms of language skills among Democratic candidates. Bernie Sanders had the best score in terms of vocabulary complexity, but he has the least ratio of unique words among his competitors. Also, one can argue that being eloquent might not be advantage to a candidate and win them an election ( look at the person who is the current president). Finally, I must emphasize that my metrics are rather arbitrary and should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\rSentiment analysis\rIn this part of my blog post, I examine how the language used by each top candidate had changed over the course of debates. I will use the tidy text approach to measure sentiment in the text.

Bernie Sanders used the highest number of words with negative sentiment in his remarks.\nPerforming sentiment analysis in tidytext is straightforward and easy, but sometimes the results are not what we hope and what the candidate actually meant. So, also take these results with a grain of salt.\n\rFurther Reading\rIf you are interested to learn more about tidy text mining in r, the following links can be helpful:\nhttps://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html\nhttps://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/conf20-tidytext/\n\r","date":1582416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582474522,"objectID":"2384d136e84da70dbe6a47ec2a434796","permalink":"/post/2020-02-23-the-most-eloquent-democratic-candidate/","publishdate":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-02-23-the-most-eloquent-democratic-candidate/","section":"post","summary":"I am not a US citizen, nor have I been to the United States, but that does not mean that I should not care about the result of the US presidential election.

Although Iran had never fully adapted Arabic as its main language, but the new Persian (Farsi) language is a mix of Arabic and the old Persian (Pahlavi) and almost use the same alphabet for writing. Also, in some parts of Iran, Arabic is the daily-life language.\rOver the past 100 years, a very few (narrowly-minded and mostly racist) scholars have tried to erase Arabic words from the Persian literature. Since I was a kid I have always wanted to I put my data science skills and tools to\nI decided to start a small project and determine how much influence Arabic has had on the Persian Lieterature and poetry over time. To put it simply, my goal is to look at every word used in poems ad determind wether it comes from Arabic or it is originally a Persian word. Then I count the occurance of each of them and compute their ratio.\nHowever, this is not an easy task for several reasons. Although determing the origin of a word is not difficult for a well-educated person, there are millions of words in Persian literary works.So, labaling each word manually is not feasible and I tried smarter ways (but less accurate ). Similar to many other languages, Persian poems are different from daily written or spoken Persian and therefore common NLP methods are not as effective as before.\nIdeally, we need a complete dataset of word with Araabic roots that are used in Persian to solve this task. But this dataset does not exist and I must use other approaches:\r1. There are a number of rules and exceptions that can be used to distinguish Persian words from Arabic words. For example, unlike Persian, Arabic does not have four letters representing “p”, “j” such as Japan, “g” such as game and “ch” in its alphabet. It means that any word that consists of one of these letters it is definitely a non-Arabic word. On the other hand, we do not have any letter in the Persian alphabet for representing the ‘th’ letter (and a few other letters) in Arabic. Therefore, words that consist of these letters are likely to be Arabic words.\n# fa --\u0026gt; Farsi (Persian)\r# ar ---\u0026gt; Arabic\r# un ----\u0026gt; Unkown\rdef arabic_word(word):\rif \u0026#39;ث\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39;\relif \u0026#39;ح\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ص\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; if \u0026#39;ض\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39;\relif \u0026#39;ظ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ع\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ط\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ق\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ژ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39;\relif \u0026#39;گ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;چ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;پ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39; else:\rreturn \u0026#39;un\u0026#39;\rUnfortunately, the rules mentioned above are not comprehensive and the origin of many words cannot be determined by them. So,I turned to the python port of the popular Langdetect library for help. Here, if the origin of a word can not be determined by the above rules, I will ask this library to identify the language. I should mention that langdetect can be sometimes wrong so the final results might not be 100% accurate.\r\rI must also mention that I performed a few preprocessing steps such as removing stopwords on the poetry corpus. A few other operations such as stemming could have been performed but my initial assessment was that they might not significantly change the final results.\rAfter preprocessing, I stored all the information about the ratio of Arabic and Persian words for each poet in a separate dataset.\nlang_ratio_df \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#39;lang_ratio_df.csv\u0026#39;)\r## Parsed with column specification:\r## cols(\r## poet = col_character(),\r## century = col_double(),\r## ar = col_double(),\r## fa = col_double(),\r## ratio = col_double(),\r## period = col_character()\r## )\rhead(lang_ratio_df)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 6\r## poet century ar fa ratio period ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 Abusaeid Abolkheir 5 3014 8277 0.364 Khorasani Style\r## 2 Ahmad Shamlou 14 8232 28862 0.285 Contemporary ## 3 Akhavan-Sales 14 3338 14937 0.223 Contemporary ## 4 Amir Khusrow 8 10582 41997 0.252 Iraqi Style ## 5 Anvari 6 29430 67188 0.438 Iraqi Style ## 6 Artimani 10 2616 7706 0.339 Indian Style\rI visualized the ratio of words for each poet using the ggplot library in R.\n lang_ratio_df %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(\rpoet = fct_reorder(poet, ratio),\rperiod = factor(\rperiod,\rlevels = c(\u0026#39;Khorasani Style\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Iraqi Style\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Indian Style\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Contemporary\u0026#39; )\r)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = poet, y = ratio , color = period)) +\rgeom_point(size = 4) +\rgeom_segment(aes(\ry = 0, yend = ratio, x = poet, xend = poet), size = 1) +\rgeom_text(\raes(x = poet, y = ratio,label = scales::percent(ratio)), size = 5, nudge_y = .2,family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;) +\rlabs( x = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;The Estimated Ratio of Arabic Words Used by Famous Persion Poets\u0026#39;) +\rscale_color_tableau() +\rscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\rcoord_flip() +\rfacet_wrap( ~ period, scales = \u0026quot;free_y\u0026quot;, ncol = 2) +\rtheme_tufte() +\rtheme(\rtext = element_text(family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;),\rlegend.title = element_text(size = 20),\raxis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\rlegend.text = element_text(\rsize = 15,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(0, 20, 0, 0)),\rplot.title = element_text(\rface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,\rcolor = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;,\rsize = 22,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(0, 20, 20, 0),\rhjust = 0.5,\rvjust = 0.5),\rstrip.text = element_text(\rcolor = \u0026#39;gray80\u0026#39;,\rsize = 18 ,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(1, 0, 1, 0)),\rlegend.position = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;,\raxis.title.x = element_blank(),\raxis.text.x = element_blank(),\raxis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, color = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;),\rplot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA))\rAs you can see above, every poet used at least a sizable number of Arabic words in his/her work. Most notably, Ferdowsi who wrote Shahname (the Book of Kings), which recount the myths and legends of Persian Kings and Heroes and is the oldest piece of poetry analyzed in my experiment also includes a considerable number of Arabic words. Other top Persian poets such as Hafez, Saadi and Rumi used Arabic words in almost 40%-50% of their works.\nNothing better can show this than the following plot which made by the ggpage package in R. The plot shows the distribution of words and their origins for several top Persian poets.

Nobody had been able to answer this question and I could not have answered it without the help of data science.\nMy analysis shows that the Arabic language has contributed significantly to our literature and culture. In fact, the golden era of Persian poetry can be seen as a result of its integration with Arabic. Persian also made its contribution to the Arabic language and Arabic poetry. So, talking about erasing one language from the other is not helpful or wise and I hope everyone realizes that.\n\r","date":1581120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581178144,"objectID":"19e5ff0ae163a6f22c89473e1a48f09b","permalink":"/post/2020-02-08-going-back-to-the-roots-how-much-influence-did-arabic-have-on-persian-literature/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-02-08-going-back-to-the-roots-how-much-influence-did-arabic-have-on-persian-literature/","section":"post","summary":"Since the conquest of Persia (now Iran) by the Muslim forces in the 7th century, Arabic culture and language have had a huge influence on Iran and Iranians.

Instead of focusing entirely on the visualization aspect of my submission, I tried to use other tools from tidy model universe for machine learning model development.\nEach song has around 12 columns representing audio features. The Github’s page for this dataset describes these features as follows:\n\r\r\r\rvariable\rclass\rdescription\r\r\r\rdanceability\rdouble\rDanceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\r\renergy\rdouble\rEnergy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\r\rkey\rdouble\rThe estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\r\rloudness\rdouble\rThe overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\r\rmode\rdouble\rMode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\r\rspeechiness\rdouble\rSpeechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\r\racousticness\rdouble\rA confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\r\rinstrumentalness\rdouble\rPredicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\r\rliveness\rdouble\rDetects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\r\rvalence\rdouble\rA measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\r\rtempo\rdouble\rThe overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\r\rduration_ms\rdouble\rDuration of song in milliseconds\r\r\r\rIt would be very helpful to compare songs based on the combination of their audio features and have an overall picture of where each song is placed. Unfortunately, we can only visualize 2 or 3 audio features at the same time and It is not possible to put all these features on a 2D or 3D space. So, I tried to use unsupervised machine learning for the purpose of visualizing songs on a 2D space by transforming their high-dimensional audio features into a more compressed form.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(tidymodels)\rlibrary(workflows)\rlibrary(gghighlight)\rlibrary(hrbrthemes)\rlibrary(ggthemes)\rlibrary(lubridate)\rlibrary(reticulate)\rlibrary(ggrepel)\rlibrary(plotly)\rlibrary(uwot)\rtheme_update(legend.position = \u0026#39;top\u0026#39;,\rlegend.text = element_text(size = 32,color = \u0026#39;gray75\u0026#39; ),\rlegend.key = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rlegend.background= element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rplot.title = element_text(family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, size = 60,hjust = 0.5,vjust = 0.5,color = \u0026#39;#FFE66D\u0026#39;,margin = ggplot2::margin(40,0,0,0)),\rplot.subtitle = element_text(\rfamily = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;, size = 30, hjust = 0.5),\rstrip.background = element_blank(),\rplot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.grid.major.x =element_blank(),\rpanel.grid.major.y =element_blank(),\rpanel.grid.minor =element_blank(),\raxis.text.x.bottom = element_blank(),\raxis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\raxis.text.x = element_blank(),\raxis.text.y.left = element_blank()) \rDimensionality Reduction and UMAP\rMy initial idea was to use some clustering algorithms to cluster songs based on their audio feature and find songs that are similar to each other. Yet, it was difficult to visualize these clusters in a two dimensional space. Of course you can do that by using hierarchal clustering but even then visualizing a few thousands samples (songs) seems to be impractical. So, I decided to to use other unsupervised techniques to compress these high-dimensional audio features and transform them into a more compact 2D space.\nThere are a number of dimensionality reduction algorithms such as PCA, t-SNE UMAP. The main purpose of these algorithm is to give us a compressed representation of the input data, which is obtained with the least possible information loss. PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction method while both t-SNE and UMAP are non-linear methods.\nIn this post, I will use UMAP and t-SNE, two widely used dimensionality reduction algorithms. When the input dataset is large T-SNE becomes very slow and is not an efficient algorithm anymore. On the other hand, UMAP can handle larger datasets much more easily. Moreover, not only UMAP can preserve the underlying local structure present in the data, but it can also represent the global structure of the data more accurately. What do we mean by local and global structure? For example, in the song dataset, persevering local structure means that songs that belong to an artist are clustered together. Similarly, global structure means that songs belonging to more related genres (e.g. hard rock, album rock and classic rock) will be placed in a close proximity of each other on the new projection\nUMAP achieves this goal by employing some advanced optimization techniques and mathematical concept. Understanding how UMAP uses these techniques and projects the input data into a more compressed representation is not crucial, but If you are curios to know more about the theory behind UMAP and its difference with T-SNE, I recommend this wonderful blogpost by Andy Coenen and Adam Pearce.\nData Preprocessing\rBoth UMAP and T-SNE compute a distance metric between samples. This distance metric should be meaningful and reasonable. If we do not scale the input features before ru some features might have higher (unfair) influence than other features on the computation of distance between samples. For this reason, it is necessary to normalize input features before implementing a them,\nI create a data preprocessing recipe using the recipe package and I add a normalization step to scale the audio features. Note that since I implement an unsupervised algorithm, there is no need to split the dataset into a training and testing dataset.\nnormalized_features \u0026lt;- spotify_songs %\u0026gt;%\rrecipe() %\u0026gt;% step_normalize( danceability,\renergy,\rkey,\rloudness,\rmode,\rspeechiness,\racousticness,\rinstrumentalness,\rliveness,\rvalence,\rtempo,\rduration_ms) %\u0026gt;% prep() %\u0026gt;% juice()\rhead(normalized_features)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 23\r## track_id track_name track_artist track_popularity track_album_id\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; ## 1 6f807x0~ I Don\u0026#39;t C~ Ed Sheeran 66 2oCs0DGTsRO98~\r## 2 0r7CVbZ~ Memories ~ Maroon 5 67 63rPSO264uRjW~\r## 3 1z1Hg7V~ All the T~ Zara Larsson 70 1HoSmj2eLcsrR~\r## 4 75Fpbth~ Call You ~ The Chainsm~ 60 1nqYsOef1yKKu~\r## 5 1e8PAfc~ Someone Y~ Lewis Capal~ 69 7m7vv9wlQ4i0L~\r## 6 7fvUMiy~ Beautiful~ Ed Sheeran 67 2yiy9cd2QktrN~\r## # ... with 18 more variables: track_album_name \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;,\r## # track_album_release_date \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, playlist_name \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, playlist_id \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;,\r## # playlist_genre \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, playlist_subgenre \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, danceability \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # energy \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, key \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, loudness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, mode \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, speechiness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # acousticness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, instrumentalness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, liveness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, valence \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # tempo \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, duration_ms \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r\r\rT-SNE\rBoth UMAP and T-SNE have several hyper-parameters that can influence the resulting embedding output.

The UMAP algorithm was originally implemented in Python. But there are also several libraries in R such as umapr, umap and uwot that also provide an implementation of the UMAP algorithm. umapr and umap use the reticulate package and provide a wrapper function around the original umap-learn python library. Also, umap and uwot library have their own R implementation and they do not require the python package to be installed beforehand. For this specific experiment, I will use the uwot library.\nwe can change and tune a few hyper-parameters in the implementation of UMAP in the uwot library, These hyperparameter can change the embedding outcome. However, there are two hyper-parameters that have a much more important impact on the structure of the low-dimensional representation:n_neighbors, min_dist and metric.\n\rn_neighbors determines the number of nearest neighbor data points that we use to compute and construct the embedding.\rmin_dist controls the minimum distance between data points in the low dimensional space (embedding). That means a low value of min_dist results in a more compact clusters of data points. On the other hand, with larger values of min_dist, the projection will be less compact and tend to preserve the global structure.\rmetric: We can use different metrics (e.g.. cosine or Euclidean) to compute the distance between data points and to find the nearest neighbors.\r\rThe choice of hyperparameter values can be very important for the final projection. However,choosing the right set of hyper-parameters in UMAP is extremely difficult because UMAP is an unsupervised algorithm and we do not have a baseline to evaluate its performance. Fortunately, UMAP is vary fast and scalable algorithm. It means that we can run UMAP with different hyperparameter settings and decide which set of values best serves our purpose.\nMy main goal from running UMAP is to visualize songs and their audio features on a 2D space and I can use a trick to decrease UMAP’s computation time. According to uwot’s documentation, if my only purpose is visualization, I can set the value of fast_sgd hyper-parameter to TRUE to speed up UMAP’s convergence and running time.\rNext, I create a grid of values for these three hyper-parameters and each time I will learn a new UMAP embedding based on different combinations of these values.\nn_neighbors \u0026lt;- c(15,30,50,100,150)\rmin_distance \u0026lt;- c( 0.001, 0.003, 0.009,0.03,0.09)\rmetrics \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;euclidean\u0026quot;

The UMAP embeddings with Euclidean distance are somehow similar to a real map. In the UMAP representation of the songs, we can see isolated clusters of songs. However, in t-SNE representation, no clear and separate cluster of points can be seen.\rWe can observe that the most influential hyper-parameter seems to be distance metric. Additionally, when we decrease the value of min_dist, the projection becomes less compact and the global structure emerges. However, we also see that sometimes music genres are not well-separated as we would like them to be. We should take into account that audio features might not be enough to distinguish between genres of music and We need to incorporate other aspects of songs such as lyrics to be able to differentiate between genres. For instance, Kaylin Pavlik in her blogpost explained how she based on similar audio features trained several machine learning models to classify songs into 6 main categories (EDM, Latin, Pop, R\u0026amp;B, Rap, \u0026amp; Rock). Her best model achieved an accuracy of 54.3%, which is a decent performance but not super accurate. I also tuned and trained a few machine learning models on this dataset but I couldn’t achieve higher performance.\n\r\rSupervised UMAP\rUMAP is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm but we can also feed target labels to UMAP and make it a supervised algorithm by specifying the target variable.

Also, an explanations is not a description.\nNevertheless, answering \u0026ldquo;what is an explanation? \u0026quot; depends on who we ask.\nPhilosopher care about the normative side of an explanation and consider a (good) explanations to be a scientific explanation. But psychologists are interested in the descriptive side or what people consider as an explanation such as everyday explanations and what makes a good explanation.\nDifferent philosophers and scientists have proposed different definition for an explanation:\nAristotle: Citing the function, the material, the category or the (efficient) cause of X.\nHempel: Producing an (logical) argument whose conclusion is the explanandum X. Salmon: Stating everything that affects the probability of X. In other words, If P(Β|Α) ≠ P(Β) then A is explanatory relevant to B (e.g. P(pregnant | male \u0026amp; contraceptives) = P(pregnant | male)). One downside of this definition is that A does not need to have a high probability to be explanatory. For example,if P(Β|Α) - P(Β) = 0.000001, A is still explanatory relevant to B.\nKitcher: Showing how X fits a more general state of affairs\nSalmon: Stating the causal history of X. An explanation of X will trace the causal processes and interactions that lead to X. But, in general, not all causal events in the past of X are explanatory relevant to X. The causal model presented by Salmon has limitation in dealing with certain type of causation such as Double Prevention. Take the following image where a pink plane wants to drop a bomb on a city. A red plane with an alligator has a mission to shoot the pink plane and prevent the bombing. Also, A blue plane is there to prevent the red plane from shooting the pink plane. Now if the the blue plane successfully shoot the red plane and the pink plane successfully drops its bomb on the city, does the blue plane cause the bombardment of the city.\nTYPES OF EXPLANATIONS Why are we interested in explanations? We seek explanations because:\n To prepare ourselves for similar events in the future : Why is the phone turned off? because it has low battery. Just to explain, understand and assign responsibilities or blames in one-off events: why did the assassination of Duke Ferdinand lead to WWI? To rationalize actions that we take: Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you vote? Because it does not make any difference To find meaning To become satisfied from explanations. The explanations are like orgasms.  Nevertheless, the explanations may not fulfill their function or objective.\nA PREFERENCE FOR TELEOLOGY However, some people and children are often biased toward teleological explanations and they are looking for the purpose not the cause in their explanations: Mountains were created to be climbed.\nExplanations virtues The following properties have been proposed as criteria of a good explanation:\n  No Circularity: \u0026ldquo;This diet pill works because it helps people lose weight\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;People lose weight because they use this diet pill\u0026rdquo; are circular arguments. Although we can detect circularity from childhood, it is not always easy to identify it.\n  Coherence : Different elements of explanation must have internal consistency. It means that an explanation must be consistent with prior knowledge and current evidence.\nHowever, explaining the full set of elements (relations) may not be simple. For instance, to fully explain how a bicycle works we need to say how its various mechanical elements interact and constrain each other.\nExplanations are incomplete (even in science) because our mental representations are skeletal and incomplete. We tend to overestimate the depth of our own understanding. But the moment we start writing down our understanding, it becomes clear that our understanding is (mostly) shallow and incomplete.\nTiger example: Tigers have dark vertical stripes on their bodies but can we tell without looking at an image of a tiger whether these stripes are vertical or horizontal on the tiger\u0026rsquo;s tail and legs?!\nBicycle example: How much do you know how a bicycle work? Draw one!\nBut sometimes compression is also needed.\n We rely heavily in expertise of other minds. In an experiment carried out by Zemla et al. (2017), it was observed that compared to other measures such as complexity, articulation, coherence, generality and truth, one of the most important measures of explanation quality for the participants was “perceived expertise”. Perceived expertise indicates whether participants believed the explanation was written by an expert. The more we we trust in the expertise of the explainer, the more likely we accept the explanation.    Relevance:\n  From philosophical point of view, only factors that make a difference to the explanandum or have a causal role should be included to generate a good explanation. This level of details is ideal but not attainable and we usually find a trade-off by abstraction. Moreover, hyper-concrete explanations are too true to be good (e.g. extremely detailed maps).\n  Strevens (2007) proposed that in order to create an optimal explanation first we need to include every imaginable event and then we remove and abstract every event that makes no difference to the occurrence of the explanandum.\n  But is it true for non-experts? Philosophical view is different from non-expert view. Weisberg et al (2008) showed that adding irrelevant neuroscientific information (e.g. jargons) to an explanation increased its perceived quality by non-experts (naïve adults and neuroscience students).\n  Another experiment was carried out in which participant were asked to rate 3 types of explanations:\n    The average ratings for the abstract explanation was significantly lower than the irrelevant explanation.\n    On the other hand, the causal ratings for the abstract explanation was higher that the other two types of explanations\n      Match the epistemic status of the audience\n When producing explanations we need to carefully asses the knowledge and beliefs of the audience.    Simplicity\n Everyone agrees that explanations should be simple. But what do we mean by simplicity? (number of entities,number of entity types, shortest description? ) Paul Thagard (1989): simplicity is determined by the number of special required assumptions. People prefer these kinds of simpler explanations because fewer assumptions means fewer unexplained causes . However, when probabilities of assumptions are also included in the explanation, people choose the most probable explanation not the simplest. In case of equal probabilities, simpler explanations are preferred. Zemla et al (2017) it showed that the quality of explanations was positively correlated both with the number of unexplained causes and its length (level of detail)    Generality (Breadth– Scope - Coverage)\n Is it better to explain more things but less precisely or fewer things but more precisely? Thagard (1992) argues that an explanations that explains more pieces of evidence should be favored.    EVALUATING EXPLANATIONS To evaluate our explanations, we need to ask a public audience. This audience can be our friends, family members and colleagues who may not have any knowledge of the system. However, we should take into account that the these evaluations can be biased and noisy. For this reason, we need to take a larger sample of people.\nAlternatively, we can also collaborate with HCI experts, psychologist and behavioral scientist to evaluate explanations.\nDifferent groups of users see different explanation and same group of users see different explanation. We need to compare different versions of our explanations (like A/B testing) .\nWe can also utilize online crowdsourcing tools and run our analysis through them:\n •Amazon Mechanical Turk – mturk.co Prolific Academic - prolific.c Gorilla - gorilla.sc Testable - testable.org  What do we need to ask?   Do they think that the provided explanation is a good explanation?\n  How well do they understand this explanation?\n  Behavioral measures such as what did they expect from the explanation?\n  Summary ","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578227399,"objectID":"aa67a1664421ca5e838a968c013ded34","permalink":"/post/2020-01-05-euads-summer-school-explanations-in-philosophy-and-psychology/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-01-05-euads-summer-school-explanations-in-philosophy-and-psychology/","section":"post","summary":"In my last post, I shared my notes from two talks at Explainable Data Science summer school in Luxembourg.

What is Data Science?** \u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; is a vague term. One might mean by \u0026ldquo;data science\u0026rdquo;:\n It is the Science of data. This definition is more frequently used by statistician and machine learning and is more theoretical. Doing science with data. This definition is more applied and data intensive. Applying science to data. This definition is also heavily applied and data intensive.  Data is not the New Oil\nSome people are overexcited about having access to huge amount of data as if they have discovered an oil field. Likewise, they believe that they can simply extract value from data and this data is a new driver for progress and prosperity. However, even if we acquire data we cannot be certain that it is valuable and we can extract value from it.\nIn other words, data in and of itself does not present value:\ndata != value but\nBut data and knowledge together can result in value. Here knowledge can be an input or an output of the data.\ndata + knowledge = value\nNow data science can defined as follows:\nIt means that Data Science has three main ingredients:\n Data  Knowledge Value   The kinds of value that Data Science can generate are:\n scientific knowledge and models societal value economic value personal value  2. From Data Mining to Data Science Many consider data mining to be the father of data science. Others say that data mining is a subset of data science. While the interest for data mining is declining, data science gain more popularity.\nFig. 2: Data science is getting more popular than data mining\nFig. 3: CRISP data mining process\nIn data mining, we (implicitly) assume that there is some value in the and our aim is to use data mining techniques to uncover it. We can see data mining just like the extraction of a valuable metals from an existing mine.\nHowever, in data science, we first need to make sure that data has some value. In other words, data science can be seen as prospective, which means we are searching for a mine to extract metal material from it. That puts more emphasis on the exploratory aspect (nature) of data science, which includes the following activities:\nThese activities do not exist in the data mining space and distinguish data science and data mining.\nData Science Trajectory (DST) space\nData mining is a more sequential and more prescriptive approach where every operation must be implemented in a specific order. All activities in data mining can be a part of a data science project but not the opposite. For instance, not every data science project requires a modeling phase. On the other hand, the goal of data science for a specific application can be just data collection or data publication.\nRead more about this in the following paper:\n CRISP-DM Twenty Years Later: From Data Mining Processes to Data Science Trajectories. Fernando Martinez-Plumed, Lidia Contreras-Ochando, Cesar Ferri, Jose Hernandez-Orallo, Meelis Kull, NicolasLachiche, Maria Jose Ramirez-Quintana and Peter Flach. (Under review, 2019)\n 3. Responsible Data Science - The Human Factor (3/5) Data Science is for, about, by and with humans and human factors should be taken into consideration at every stage of a data science project. But it is not always easy to measure, define and ultimately achieve them.\nFor example, look at following table which shows the number and the percentage of students who applied and were admitted to a university.\nAt the first glance, this table might suggest a case of bias toward women in the admission process. However, further examinations show that the low percentage of total admissions for women is due to the fact that female applicants tended to apply to more difficult programs with an overall lower chance of acceptance while men applied to easier programs with a higher probability of acceptance. In other words, the difficulty of programs was a confounding factor that influenced the outcome not gender bias. It indicates measuring a human factor such as fairness is not easy because measuring bias is not easy. Furthermore, according to Goodhart\u0026rsquo;s Law, the moment we decide to use these metrics (e.g. bias) as our target to optimize, they are not good measures anymore.\nin the the rest of talk, Peter Flach discussed the relationship between GDPR and fairness and specifically he touched upon an important issue regarding data ownership and the role of GDPR for personal data protection.\nHe provided an example of authorship to demonstrate that solving data ownership is not a simple task. If someone writes a book about someone else (e.g. Clinton), the author has the ownership and the copyright not the the person whom the book is about.\nResources:\nSlides  Model-Based Machine Learning  This talk was dedicated to Sabine Krolak-Schwerdt who unfortunately passed away recently and was one of the founders of EuADS.\n Three factors have contributed to the popularity and the recent success of AI  More computing power Large amount of available data (Big data) More powerful algorithms  Dozens of machine learning algorithms have been developed.\nBut the \u0026lsquo;No Free Lunch Theorem\u0026rsquo; states that no universal machine learning can solve every problem.\n Averaged over all possible data distributions, every classification algorithm has the same error rate when classifying previously unobserved points. D. Wolpert (1996)\n This means that the goal of machine learning is to find an algorithm that is well-suited to the problem that being solved.\nModel-Based machine learning In the traditional machine learning paradigm, ML algorithms play a centric role. We start by an ML algorithm and we would like to know how we can apply it to our problem.\nHowever, in model-based machine learning paradigm, we are looking to find a well-matched algorithm for our problem. We can derive a model that best represents our problem by making explicit modeling assumptions.\nData and prior knowledge Scenario 1: we have collected a handful of voltage and current measurement from an experiment. and we want to determine the relationship between the current and voltage using these measurements.\nScenario 2: We have a huge database containing images from 1000 objects and our goal is to develop a model to classify each image correctly.\nBut are these datasets \u0026lsquo;big\u0026rsquo; enough for solving their corresponding problems. In the first scenario, although we only have a few measurements, we know that they are enough for finding the relationship between voltage and current. On the other hand, even though we have access to a large number of images for each class, these images do not represent the distribution of all images.\n The trade-off between prior knowledge and the amount of data needed\nTherefore, we must distinguish between two types of \u0026lsquo;big data\u0026rsquo;:\n In terms of size In terms of being statistically significant  Then, Chris Bishop argued that we need to incorporate uncertainties into our machine learning models otherwise the consequences would be dire. It means that we should never ever build direct classifier but we should build probabilistic classifier.\nWhy is that? Because not all misclassification errors are equal and different costs are assigned to different errors. Misclassifying a patient with cancer may be much worse than misclassifying a healthy patient. So, instead of minimizing the number of misclassified instances, we can minimize the expected (average costs).\nFinally, Chris Bishop presented a demo of a movie recommendation system.\nResources:\nSlides\nModel-Based Machine Learning ","date":1577750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577792792,"objectID":"ec240810c875bcfce8efb59e8e36b305","permalink":"/post/2019-12-31-explainable-data-science-summer-school/","publishdate":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-31-explainable-data-science-summer-school/","section":"post","summary":"Last September, I had the opportunity to participate in the EXPLAINABLE DATA SCIENCE summer school in Kirchberg, Luxembourg. the summer school was organized by the European Association for Data Science (EuADS) and was held during 10-13 September.\nWhat I specifically liked about this summer school ( of course besides enjoying the the beautiful city of Luxembourg ) was the fact that it covered a vast variety of topics in the explainable machine learning (AI) literature, ranging from visualization, XAI techniques, causality to psychological aspects of explainability.","tags":["XAI","Machine Learning"],"title":"Explainable Data Science Summer School","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R","Tidy Tuesday"],"content":"\rFor 6 years I had been using python exclusively as the main tool for carrying out my data science tasks and running my experiments.
