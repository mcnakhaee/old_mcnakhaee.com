Rationalizing actions: To find meaning To become satisfied from explanations  People and children are often biased toward teleological explanations ( looking for the purpose not the cause):\n​\tMountains were created to be climbed.\nProperties of a good explanations\n  No Circularity\n  Coherence :\nDifferent elements of explanation must have internal consistency (i.e. with prior knowledge and current evidence)\nExplaining the full set of elements is not feasible (explaining how a bicycle works we need to say how its various mechanical elements interact and constrain each other)\nExplanations are incomplete (even in science) because our mental representations are skeletal and incomplete. We have an illusion that we deeply understand and we can explain things.\nTiger example: Tigers have dark vertical stripes on their bodies but without looking at an image of a tiger answer whether these stripes are vertical or horizontal on the tiger's tail and legs.\n How much do you know how a bicycle work? Draw one! One of the most important measure of explanation quality was “perceived expertise”, i.e. whether participants believed the explanation was written by an expert. (Zemla et al (2017))    Relevance:\n  From philosophical point of view, only factors that make a difference to the explanandum should be included to generate a good explanation.\n  But is it true for non-experts? Weisberg et al (2008) showed that adding irrelevant neuroscientific information (e.g. jargons) to an explanation increased its perceived quality for non-experts.\n  Another experiment in which participant were asked to rate 3 types of explanations:\n    The average ratings for the abstract explanation was significantly lower than the irrelevant explanation.\n    On the other hand, the causal ratings for the abstract explanation was higher that the other two types of explanations\n      Match the epistemic status of the audience:\n When producing explanations we need to carefully assess the knowledge and beliefs of the audience    Simplicity\n What do we mean by simplicity? (number of entities,number of entity types, shortest description? ) Paul Thagard (1989): simplicity is determined by the number of special assumptions required. People prefer these kinds of simpler explanations because fewer assumptions means fewer unexplained causes . However when probabilities of are included in explanations, people choose the most probable explanation not the simplest. In Zemla et al (2017) it was shown that the quality of explanations was positively correlated both with the number of unexplained causes and its length (level of detail)    Generality (Breadth– Scope - Coverage)\n  EVALUATING EXPLANATIONS\nDo the users think that an explanation is good explanation\nHow well do they understand this explanation\nWe need to compare different versions of our explanations (like A/B testing)\nDifferent groups of users see different explanation and same group of users see different explanation.\nTo evaluate our explanations we have to ask a public audience. This audience can be our friends, family members and colleagues who may not have any knowledge of the system. However, we should take into account that the these evaluations can be biased and noisy. For this reason, we need to take a large sample.\nAlternatively we can collaborate with HCI experts, psychologist and behavioral scientist to evaluate explanations.\nwe can also utilize online crowdsourcing tools and run our analysis through them:\n•Amazon Mechanical Turk – mturk.com • Prolific Academic - prolific.co • Gorilla - gorilla.sc • Testable - testable.org\nExperiment\n","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578227399,"objectID":"aa67a1664421ca5e838a968c013ded34","permalink":"/post/2020-01-05-euads-summer-school-explanations-in-philosophy-and-psychology/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-01-05-euads-summer-school-explanations-in-philosophy-and-psychology/","section":"post","summary":"*Explanations in Philosophy and Psychology*: Christos Bechlivanidis, Explanations are always expressed in a contrastive manner and this contrast is usually implied by the context.\n  Producers and consumers of explanations in AI   The developer who produces the explanation and evaluates it or as Miller et al (2017), the inmates are running the asylum phenomena.\nBut what makes the good explanation for the developer is not necessarily good for other users of the system.","tags":["XAI"],"title":"EuADS Summer School: Explanations in Philosophy and Psychology","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["XAI"],"content":"\rThis talk was mainly focused on the importance of visualization and other techniques for exploring and explaining data.

In addition, the summer school has a special guest, the legendary Christopher Bishop who gave the inaugural lecture.\nYou can find the complete program and the presentations in the EuADS's website. Nevertheless during some presentations in the summer school, I took notes and I summarized them.\n Disclaimer:\nSometimes it is not easy to keep up with the speaker and take notes. Also, it is possible that what I wrote down is just my interpretation and not what the speaker intened to say. For this reason, I do not guarantee that all details in this post are accurate or what the speakers wanted to communicate.\n From Data Mining to Data Science - Peter Flach (EuADS President) 1. What is Data Science?** \u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; is a vague term. One might mean by \u0026ldquo;data science\u0026rdquo;:\n It is the Science of data. This definition is more frequently used by statistician and machine learning and is more theoretical. Doing science with data. This definition is more applied and data intensive. Applying science to data. This definition is also heavily applied and data intensive.  Data is not the New Oil\nSome people are overexcited about having access to huge amount of data as if they have discovered an oil field. Likewise, they believe that they can simply extract value from data and this data is a new driver for progress and prosperity. However, even if we acquire data we cannot be certain that it is valuable and we can extract value from it.\nIn other words, data in and of itself does not present value:\ndata != value but\nBut data and knowledge together can result in value. Here knowledge can be an input or an output of the data.\ndata + knowledge = value\nNow data science can defined as follows:\nIt means that Data Science has three main ingredients:\n Data  Knowledge Value   The kinds of value that Data Science can generate are:\n scientific knowledge and models societal value economic value personal value  2. From Data Mining to Data Science Many consider data mining to be the father of data science. Others say that data mining is a subset of data science. While the interest for data mining is declining, data science gain more popularity.\nFig. 2: Data science is getting more popular than data mining\nFig. 3: CRISP data mining process\nIn data mining, we (implicitly) assume that there is some value in the and our aim is to use data mining techniques to uncover it. We can see data mining just like the extraction of a valuable metals from an existing mine.\nHowever, in data science, we first need to make sure that data has some value. In other words, data science can be seen as prospective, which means we are searching for a mine to extract metal material from it. That puts more emphasis on the exploratory aspect (nature) of data science, which includes the following activities:\nThese activities do not exist in the data mining space and distinguish data science and data mining.\nData Science Trajectory (DST) space\nData mining is a more sequential and more prescriptive approach where every operation must be implemented in a specific order. All activities in data mining can be a part of a data science project but not the opposite. For instance, not every data science project requires a modeling phase. On the other hand, the goal of data science for a specific application can be just data collection or data publication.\nRead more about this in the following paper:\n CRISP-DM Twenty Years Later: From Data Mining Processes to Data Science Trajectories. Fernando Martinez-Plumed, Lidia Contreras-Ochando, Cesar Ferri, Jose Hernandez-Orallo, Meelis Kull, NicolasLachiche, Maria Jose Ramirez-Quintana and Peter Flach. (Under review, 2019)\n 3. Responsible Data Science - The Human Factor (3/5) Data Science is for, about, by and with humans and human factors should be taken into consideration at every stage of a data science project. But it is not always easy to measure, define and ultimately achieve them.\nFor example, look at following table which shows the number and the percentage of students who applied and were admitted to a university.\nAt the first glance, this table might suggest a case of bias toward women in the admission process. However, further examinations show that the low percentage of total admissions for women is due to the fact that female applicants tended to apply to more difficult programs with an overall lower chance of acceptance while men applied to easier programs with a higher probability of acceptance. In other words, the difficulty of programs was a confounding factor that influenced the outcome not gender bias. It indicates measuring a human factor such as fairness is not easy because measuring bias is not easy. Furthermore, according to Goodhart's Law, the moment we decide to use these metrics (e.g. bias) as our target to optimize, they are not good measures anymore.\nin the the rest of talk, Peter Flach discussed the relationship between GDPR and fairness and specifically he touched upon an important issue regarding data ownership and the role of GDPR for personal data protection.\nHe provided an example of authorship to demonstrate that solving data ownership is not a simple task. If someone writes a book about someone else (e.g. Clinton), the author has the ownership and the copyright not the the person whom the book is about.\nResources:\nSlides  Model-Based Machine Learning  This talk was dedicated to Sabine Krolak-Schwerdt who unfortunately passed away recently and was one of the founders of EuADS.\n Three factors have contributed to the popularity and the recent success of AI  More computing power Large amount of available data (Big data) More powerful algorithms  Dozens of machine learning algorithms have been developed.\nBut the \u0026lsquo;No Free Lunch Theorem\u0026rsquo; states that no universal machine learning can solve every problem.\n Averaged over all possible data distributions, every classification algorithm has the same error rate when classifying previously unobserved points. D. Wolpert (1996)\n This means that the goal of machine learning is to find an algorithm that is well-suited to the problem that being solved.\nModel-Based machine learning In the traditional machine learning paradigm, ML algorithms play a centric role. We start by an ML algorithm and we would like to know how we can apply it to our problem.\nHowever, in model-based machine learning paradigm, we are looking to find a well-matched algorithm for our problem. We can derive a model that best represents our problem by making explicit modeling assumptions.\nData and prior knowledge Scenario 1: we have collected a handful of voltage and current measurement from an experiment. and we want to determine the relationship between the current and voltage using these measurements.\nScenario 2: We have a huge database containing images from 1000 objects and our goal is to develop a model to classify each image correctly.\nBut are these datasets \u0026lsquo;big\u0026rsquo; enough for solving their corresponding problems. In the first scenario, although we only have a few measurements, we know that they are enough for finding the relationship between voltage and current. On the other hand, even though we have access to a large number of images for each class, these images do not represent the distribution of all images.\n The trade-off between prior knowledge and the amount of data needed\nTherefore, we must distinguish between two types of \u0026lsquo;big data\u0026rsquo;:\n In terms of size In terms of being statistically significant  Then, Chris Bishop argued that we need to incorporate uncertainties into our machine learning models otherwise the consequences would be dire. It means that we should never ever build direct classifier but we should build probabilistic classifier.\nWhy is that? Because not all misclassification errors are equal and different costs are assigned to different errors. Misclassifying a patient with cancer may be much worse than misclassifying a healthy patient. So, instead of minimizing the number of misclassified instances, we can minimize the expected (average costs).\nFinally, Chris Bishop presented a demo of a movie recommendation system.\nResources:\nSlides\nModel-Based Machine Learning ","date":1577750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577792792,"objectID":"ec240810c875bcfce8efb59e8e36b305","permalink":"/post/2019-12-31-explainable-data-science-summer-school/","publishdate":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-31-explainable-data-science-summer-school/","section":"post","summary":"Last September, I had the opportunity to participate in the EXPLAINABLE DATA SCIENCE summer school in Kirchberg, Luxembourg. the summer school was organized by the European Association for Data Science (EuADS) and was held during 10-13 September.\nWhat I specifically liked about this summer school ( of course besides enjoying the the beautiful city of Luxembourg ) was the fact that it covered a vast variety of topics in the explainable machine learning (AI) literature, ranging from visualization, XAI techniques, causality to psychological aspects of explainability.","tags":["XAI","Machine Learning"],"title":"Explainable Data Science Summer School","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R","Tidy Tuesday"],"content":"\rFor 6 years, I had been using python exclusively as the main tool for carrying out my data science tasks and running my experiments.
