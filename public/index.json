In addition, the summer school has a special guest, the legendary Christopher Bishop who gave the inaugural lecture.\nFirst Day\nFrom Data Mining Processes to Data Science Trajectories\n*“Model-Based Machine Learning“*\nSecond Day\n* *Human-Centric Data Exploration*: Tijl De Bie (U Ghent, Belgium) * *Explanations in Philosophy and Psychology*: Christos Bechlivanidis, (University College London, UK)\nThird Day\n*** *XAI – Science and technology for the explanation of AI decision making*: Fosca Giannotti** (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory, Italy)~~~~ * ***Making Data Science Intelligible*:Simone Stumpf** (City, U of London, UK)\nFourth Day\n* *Causal Inference from Empirical Data*: Jilles Vreeken (Saarland U, Germany)\nDuring some presentations, I took notes and I summarized them.\nDisclaimer:\nFrom Data Mining to Data Science - Peter Flach (EuADS President) What is Data Science?\n\u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; is a vague term. One might mean by \u0026ldquo;data science\u0026rdquo;:\n It is the Science of data. This definition is more frequently used by statistician and machine learning and is more theoretical. Doing science with data. This definition is more applied and data intensive. Applying science to data. This definition is also heavily applied and data intensive.  Data is not the New Oil\nSome people are over excited about having access to huge amount of data. They think that we can extract value from data and data is a new driver for progress and prosperity. However, even if we acquire data we cannot be certain that it is valuable and we can extract value from it.\nIn other words:\ndata != value but data + knowledge = value\n(Here knowledge can be an input or an output of data)\nThe kinds of value that Data Science can generate:\n scientific knowledge and models societal value economic value personal value  Therefore, Data Science has three main ingredients:\n Data  Knowledge Value   From Data Mining to Data Science One might consider data mining as the father of data science or we may even say that data mining is a subset of data science.\nIn data mining, we (implicitly) assume that there is value in the data and we are trying to use data mining and its techniques to uncover it. In another words, data mining is like mining a precious material in an existing mine.\nHowever, in data science, first we to check whether the data has value. In another words, data science is prospective which means we are looking for a mine to extract precious material from it. That puts an emphasis on the exploratory aspect (nature) of data science which includes the following activities:\nThese activities do not exist in the data mining space and make a distinction between data science and data mining.\nData mining is a more sequential approach where every operation must be implemented in a specific order. All activities in data mining can be a part of a data science project but not the opposite. For instance, not every data science projects requires a modeling phase. The goal of a data science might be just data collection or data publication.\nResponsible Data Science - The Human Factor (3/5) Data Science is for, about, by and with humans. Therefore, human factors should be taken into consideration at every stage of a data science project.\nHowever, it is always easy to measure or even define them.\nFor instance, take the following table which shows the number and the percentage of students who applied and admitted to a university.\nIt seems that the above table may represent an example of bias and toward women in admission process. However, further investigations reveal that the low percentage of total admissions for women was due to the fact that women tended to apply to more difficult programs while men applied to easier programs which had a higher chance of admission. In other words, the difficulty of programs was a confounding factor which influenced the outcome.\nSo, measuring fairness is not easy because measuring bias is not easy.\nFurthermore, according to Goodhart's Law, the moment we decide to use these measures of bias as our target to optimize, they are not good measures anymore.\nin the the rest of talk, Peter Flach discussed the relationship between GDPR and fairness and specifically he touched upon an important issue regarding data ownership and the role of GDPR for personal data protection .\nMore resources\nCRISP-DM Twenty Years Later: From Data Mining Processes to Data Science Trajectories. Fernando Martinez-Plumed, Lidia Contreras Ochando, Cesar Ferri, Jose Hernandez-Orallo, Meelis Kull, Nicolas Lachiche, Maria Jose Ramirez-Quintana and Peter Flach. (Under review, 2019)\nModel-Based Machine Learning  This talk was dedicated to Sabine Krolak-Schwerdt who unfortunately passed away recently and was one of the founders of EuADS.\n Three factors have contributed to the popularity and the success of AI  More computing power Large amount of available data (Big data) More powerful algorithms  No Free Lunch Theorem and no universal machine learning model.\nThere is no machine learning model that can solve every problem.\nModel-Based machine learning The traditional machine learning approach, ML algorithms play a centric role. Here we have an ML algorithm and we would like to know how we can apply it to our problem.\nHowever, in model-based machine learning we are looking to derive a model that best represents our problem by making explicit modeling assumptions.\nWhat we might mea by big:\n In terms of size In terms of being statistically significant  Then Chris Bishop argued that we need to incorporate uncertainties into our machine learning models otherwise the consequences could be dire.\nIt can provide us with a few benefits:\n*Explanations in Philosophy and Psychology*: Christos Bechlivanidis, Explanations are always expressed in a contrastive manner.\nWhat is an explanation?\nAn explanations is not a description\nThe developer who produces the explanation and evaluates it. (The inmates are running the asylum phenomena)\nWhen producing explanations we need to carefully assess the knowledge and beliefs of the audience\nPhilosopher: What is a (good) explanations (e.g. scientific explanations)\nPsychologists : What do people consider an explanations and what makes a good explanations (e.g. everyday explanations)\nBut why? An introduction to causal inference from empirical data**  what is causation? how can we measure causation? how can we discover causation?  Causation is not correlation but what is it?\n The relationship between something that happens or exists and the things that cause it to happen or exist\n Causal inference\n The process of reasoning to the conclusion that something is or is likely to be, the cause of something else\n Explanations for a Psychological Perspective\nExplanations are always said in a contrastive manner depending on the context\nMiller et al (2017): The inmates are running the asylum\nDifferent types of explanation complexities for different audience:\nFred\nExplanation is not a description\nPsychologists care about the descriptive side: what do people see as an explanation \u0026amp; what properties do they value in an explanation compared to the normative view on explanations used by philosophers which focuses on answering the questions what is a (good) explanation\nDifferent definition of explanations proposed by different philosophers over time • Aristotle: Citing the function, the material, the category or the (efficient) cause of X\n•Hempel: Producing an (logical) argument whose conclusion is X (explanandum) • Salmon Stating everything that affects the probability of X • Stating the causal history of X • Showing how X fits a more general state of affairs\nTYPES OF EXPLANATIONS\nWhy are we interested in explanations?\n To prepare ourselves for the futures events: Why is the phone turned off? because it has low battery. Just to understand or assign blames in one-off events: why did the assassination of Duke Ferdinand led to WWI? Rationalizing actions: To find meaning To become satisfied from explanations  People and children are often biased toward teleological explanations ( looking for the purpose not the cause):\n​\tMountains were created to be climbed.\nProperties of a good explanations\n  No Circularity\n  Coherence :\nDifferent elements of explanation must have internal consistency (i.e. with prior knowledge and current evidence)\nExplaining the full set of elements is not feasible (explaining how a bicycle works we need to say how its various mechanical elements interact and constrain each other)\nExplanations are incomplete (even in science) because our mental representations are skeletal and incomplete. We have an illusion that we deeply understand and we can explain things.\nTiger example: Tigers have dark vertical stripes on their bodies but without looking at an image of a tiger answer whether these stripes are vertical or horizontal on the tiger's tail and legs.\n How much do you know how a bicycle work? Draw one! One of the most important measure of explanation quality was “perceived expertise”, i.e. whether participants believed the explanation was written by an expert. (Zemla et al (2017))    Relevance:\n  From philosophical point of view, only factors that make a difference to the explanandum should be included to generate a good explanation.\n  But is it true for non-experts? Weisberg et al (2008) showed that adding irrelevant neuroscientific information (e.g. jargons) to an explanation increased its perceived quality for non-experts.\n  Another experiment in which participant were asked to rate 3 types of explanations:\n    The average ratings for the abstract explanation was significantly lower than the irrelevant explanation.\n    On the other hand, the causal ratings for the abstract explanation was higher that the other two types of explanations\n      Match the epistemic status of the audience\n  Simplicity\n What do we mean by simplicity? (number of entities,number of entity types, shortest description? )  Paul Thagard (1989): simplicity is determined by the number of special assumptions required.
