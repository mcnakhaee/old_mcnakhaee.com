Although Iran had never fully adapted Arabic as its main language, but the new Persian (Farsi) language is a mix of Arabic and the old Persian (Pahlavi) and almost use the same alphabet for writing. Also, in some parts of Iran, Arabic is the daily-life language.\rOver the past 100 years, a very few (narrowly-minded and mostly racist) scholars have tried to erase Arabic words from the Persian literature. Since I was a kid I have always wanted to I put my data science skills and tools to\nI decided to start a small project and determine how much influence Arabic has had on the Persian Lieterature and poetry over time. To put it simply, my goal is to look at every word used in poems ad determind wether it comes from Arabic or it is originally a Persian word. Then I count the occurance of each of them and compute their ratio.\nHowever, this is not an easy task for several reasons. Although determing the origin of a word is not difficult for a well-educated person, there are millions of words in Persian literary works.So, labaling each word manually is not feasible and I tried smarter ways (but less accurate ). Similar to many other languages, Persian poems are different from daily written or spoken Persian and therefore common NLP methods are not as effective as before.\nIdeally, we need a complete dataset of word with Araabic roots that are used in Persian to solve this task. But this dataset does not exist and I must use other approaches:\r1. There are a number of rules and exceptions that can be used to distinguish Persian words from Arabic words. For example, unlike Persian, Arabic does not have four letters representing “p”, “j” such as Japan, “g” such as game and “ch” in its alphabet. It means that any word that consists of one of these letters it is definitely a non-Arabic word. On the other hand, we do not have any letter in the Persian alphabet for representing the ‘th’ letter (and a few other letters) in Arabic. Therefore, words that consist of these letters are likely to be Arabic words.\n# fa --\u0026gt; Farsi (Persian)\r# ar ---\u0026gt; Arabic\r# un ----\u0026gt; Unkown\rdef arabic_word(word):\rif \u0026#39;ث\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39;\relif \u0026#39;ح\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ص\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; if \u0026#39;ض\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39;\relif \u0026#39;ظ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ع\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ط\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ق\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;ar\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;ژ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39;\relif \u0026#39;گ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;چ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39; elif \u0026#39;پ\u0026#39; in word:\rreturn \u0026#39;fa\u0026#39; else:\rreturn \u0026#39;un\u0026#39;\rUnfortunately, the rules mentioned above are not comprehensive and the origin of many words cannot be determined by them. So,I turned to the python port of the popular Langdetect library for help. Here, if the origin of a word can not be determined by the above rules, I will ask this library to identify the language. I should mention that langdetect can be sometimes wrong so the final results might not be 100% accurate.\r\rfrom langdetect import detect\rx = \u0026#39;from langdetect import detect\u0026#39;\r# The word for \u0026quot;people\u0026quot; in Persian\rprint(detect(\u0026quot;مردم\u0026quot;))\r# A word used both in Arabic and also Persian\r## fa\rprint(detect(\u0026quot;عقل\u0026quot;))\r## ar\rx\r## \u0026#39;from langdetect import detect\u0026#39;\rI must also mention that I performed a few preprocessing steps such as removing stopwords on the poetry corpus. A few other operations such as stemming could have been performed but my initial assessment was that they might not significantly change the final results.\rAfter preprocessing, I stored all the information about the ratio of Arabic and Persian words for each poet in a separate dataset.\nlang_ratio_df \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#39;lang_ratio_df.csv\u0026#39;)\r## Parsed with column specification:\r## cols(\r## poet = col_character(),\r## century = col_double(),\r## ar = col_double(),\r## fa = col_double(),\r## ratio = col_double(),\r## period = col_character()\r## )\rhead(lang_ratio_df)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 6\r## poet century ar fa ratio period ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 Abusaeid Abolkheir 5 3014 8277 0.364 Khorasani Style\r## 2 Ahmad Shamlou 14 8232 28862 0.285 Contemporary ## 3 Akhavan-Sales 14 3338 14937 0.223 Contemporary ## 4 Amir Khusrow 8 10582 41997 0.252 Iraqi Style ## 5 Anvari 6 29430 67188 0.438 Iraqi Style ## 6 Artimani 10 2616 7706 0.339 Indian Style\rI visualized the ratio of words for each poet using the ggplot library in R.\n lang_ratio_df %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(\rpoet = fct_reorder(poet, ratio),\rperiod = factor(\rperiod,\rlevels = c(\u0026#39;Khorasani Style\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Iraqi Style\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Indian Style\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Contemporary\u0026#39; )\r)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = poet, y = ratio , color = period)) +\rgeom_point(size = 4) +\rgeom_segment(aes(\ry = 0, yend = ratio, x = poet, xend = poet), size = 1) +\rgeom_text(\raes(x = poet, y = ratio,label = scales::percent(ratio)), size = 5, nudge_y = .2,family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;) +\rlabs( x = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, y = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, title = \u0026#39;The Estimated Ratio of Arabic Words Used by Famous Persion Poets\u0026#39;) +\rscale_color_tableau() +\rscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\rcoord_flip() +\rfacet_wrap( ~ period, scales = \u0026quot;free_y\u0026quot;, ncol = 2) +\rtheme_tufte() +\rtheme(\rtext = element_text(family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;),\rlegend.title = element_text(size = 20),\raxis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\rlegend.text = element_text(\rsize = 15,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(0, 20, 0, 0)),\rplot.title = element_text(\rface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;,\rcolor = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;,\rsize = 22,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(0, 20, 20, 0),\rhjust = 0.5,\rvjust = 0.5),\rstrip.text = element_text(\rcolor = \u0026#39;gray80\u0026#39;,\rsize = 18 ,\rmargin = ggplot2::margin(1, 0, 1, 0)),\rlegend.position = \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;,\raxis.title.x = element_blank(),\raxis.text.x = element_blank(),\raxis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, color = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;),\rplot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA))\rAs you can see above, every poet used at least a sizable number of Arabic words in his/her work. Most notably, Ferdowsi who wrote Shahname (the Book of Kings), which recount the myths and legends of Persian Kings and Heroes and is the oldest piece of poetry analyzed in my experiment also includes a considerable number of Arabic words. Other top Persian poets such as Hafez, Saadi and Rumi used Arabic words in almost 40%-50% of their works.\nNothing better can show this than the following plot which made by the ggpage package in R. The plot shows the distribution of words and their origins for several top Persian poets.

Nobody had been able to answer this question and I could not have answered it without the help of data science.\nMy analysis shows that the Arabic language has contributed significantly to our literature and culture. In fact, the golden era of Persian poetry can be seen as a result of its integration with Arabic. Persian also made its contribution to the Arabic language and Arabic poetry. So, talking about erasing one language from the other is not helpful or wise and I hope everyone realizes that.\n\r","date":1581120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581178144,"objectID":"19e5ff0ae163a6f22c89473e1a48f09b","permalink":"/post/2020-02-08-going-back-to-the-roots-how-much-influence-did-arabic-have-on-persian-literature/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-02-08-going-back-to-the-roots-how-much-influence-did-arabic-have-on-persian-literature/","section":"post","summary":"Since the conquest of Persia (now Iran) by the Muslim forces in the 7th century, Arabic culture and language have had a huge influence on Iran and Iranians.

Instead of focusing entirely on the visualization aspect of my submission, I tried to use other tools from tidy model universe for machine learning model development.\nEach song has around 12 columns representing audio features. The Github’s page for this dataset describes these features as follows:\n\r\r\r\rvariable\rclass\rdescription\r\r\r\rdanceability\rdouble\rDanceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\r\renergy\rdouble\rEnergy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\r\rkey\rdouble\rThe estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\r\rloudness\rdouble\rThe overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\r\rmode\rdouble\rMode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\r\rspeechiness\rdouble\rSpeechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\r\racousticness\rdouble\rA confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\r\rinstrumentalness\rdouble\rPredicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\r\rliveness\rdouble\rDetects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\r\rvalence\rdouble\rA measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\r\rtempo\rdouble\rThe overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\r\rduration_ms\rdouble\rDuration of song in milliseconds\r\r\r\rIt would be very helpful to compare songs based on the combination of their audio features. However, It is not possible to plot all these features at the same time on a 2 or 3 dimensional space.\nFor this reason, I tried to use unsupervised machine learning for the purpose of visualizing songs on a 2D space by transforming their high-dimensional audio features into a more compressed form.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(tidymodels)\rlibrary(workflows)\rlibrary(gghighlight)\rlibrary(hrbrthemes)\rlibrary(ggthemes)\rlibrary(lubridate)\rlibrary(reticulate)\rlibrary(ggrepel)\rtheme_update(legend.position = \u0026#39;top\u0026#39;,\rlegend.text = element_text(size = 24),\rplot.title = element_text(family = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, size = 50,hjust = 0.5, color = \u0026#39;#FFE66D\u0026#39;),\rplot.subtitle = element_text(\rfamily = \u0026#39;Montserrat\u0026#39;, size = 30, hjust = 0.5),\rstrip.background = element_blank(),\rplot.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.background = element_rect(fill = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;),\rpanel.grid.major.x =element_blank(),\rpanel.grid.major.y =element_blank(),\rpanel.grid.minor =element_blank(),\raxis.text.x.bottom = element_blank(),\raxis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\raxis.text.x = element_blank(),\raxis.text.y.left = element_blank()) \rDimensionality Reduction and UMAP\rMy initial idea was to use clustering algorithms to cluster songs based on their audio feature and find songs that are similar to each other. Yet, it was difficult to visualize these clusters in a two dimensional space. Of course you can do that by using hierarchal clustering but even then visualizing a few thousands samples (songs) can not be done easily. So, I decided to to use other unsupervised techniques to compress the high-dimensional audio features and transform them into a 2D space. One main purpose of the UMAP algorithm is to give us a compressed representation of the input data for visualization with the least possible information loss.\nThere are a number of dimensionality reduction algorithms such as PCA, t-SNE UMAP. PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction method while both t-SNE and UMAP are non-linear methods. In this post I will use UMAP and t-SNE algorithms.\nData Preprocessing\rThe songs’ track names in this dataset are too long. Just for the purpose of the final visualization, the first thing that I did was to make the track names shorter by using both python and R.\nspotify_songs \u0026lt;- spotify_songs %\u0026gt;% dplyr::rowwise() %\u0026gt;% mutate(shorter_names = unlist(str_split(track_name,\u0026#39;-\u0026#39;))[1]) \rNote that both UMAP and T-SNE compute the distance between samples and this distance should be meaningful and reasonable. It is necessary to normalize input features before implementing a them, otherwise some features might have higher influence than other features on the computation of distance between samples.\nI created a data preprocessing recipe using the recipe package and I added a normalization step to scale only the audio features.\nSince I implement an unsupervised algorithm, there is no need to split the dataset into a training and testing dataset.\nnormalized_features \u0026lt;- spotify_songs %\u0026gt;%\rrecipe() %\u0026gt;% step_normalize( danceability,\renergy,\rkey,\rloudness,\rmode,\rspeechiness,\racousticness,\rinstrumentalness,\rliveness,\rvalence,\rtempo,\rduration_ms) %\u0026gt;% prep() %\u0026gt;% juice()\rhead(normalized_features)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 24\r## track_id track_name track_artist track_popularity track_album_id\r## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; ## 1 6f807x0~ I Don\u0026#39;t C~ Ed Sheeran 66 2oCs0DGTsRO98~\r## 2 0r7CVbZ~ Memories ~ Maroon 5 67 63rPSO264uRjW~\r## 3 1z1Hg7V~ All the T~ Zara Larsson 70 1HoSmj2eLcsrR~\r## 4 75Fpbth~ Call You ~ The Chainsm~ 60 1nqYsOef1yKKu~\r## 5 1e8PAfc~ Someone Y~ Lewis Capal~ 69 7m7vv9wlQ4i0L~\r## 6 7fvUMiy~ Beautiful~ Ed Sheeran 67 2yiy9cd2QktrN~\r## # ... with 19 more variables: track_album_name \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;,\r## # track_album_release_date \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, playlist_name \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, playlist_id \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;,\r## # playlist_genre \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, playlist_subgenre \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;, danceability \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # energy \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, key \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, loudness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, mode \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, speechiness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # acousticness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, instrumentalness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, liveness \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, valence \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;,\r## # tempo \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, duration_ms \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, shorter_names \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt;\rBoth UMAP and T-SNE have several hyper-parameters that can influence the resulting embedding output.\rFor the sake of simplicity, I did not change the default values for these hyper-parameters.\nJust like t-SNE, UMAP is a dimensionality reduction algorithm but it is much more computationally efficient and faster that t-SNE. The UMAP algorithm was originally implemented in Python. But there are also several libraries in R such as umapr, umap and uwot that also provide an implementation of the UMAP algorithm. umapr and umap use the reticulate package and provide a wrapper function around the original umap-learn python library. Also, umap and uwot library have their own R implementation of the algorithms and they do not require the python package to be installed first. For my experiment, I used the uwot library.\nNow that I had the learned embeddings for both t-SNE and UMAP, it was time to put the side by side.\nembeddings \u0026lt;- spotify_songs %\u0026gt;% select(-c(12:22)) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(tsne_embedding$Y %\u0026gt;% as_tibble()) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::rename(tsne_1 = V1, tsne_2 = V2) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(umap_embedding$layout %\u0026gt;% as_tibble() ) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::rename(umap_1 = V1, umap_2 = V2) \rEven though I managed to transform a high dimensional dataset into a 2D space, still it was very challenging to visualize every song and every artists all at once.

I learned a lot of new things from this this talk specially because what I had focused by them was mainly about the more algorithmic aspect of explainability. In this post I am going to share my notes from this talk. The slides for this talk can be downloaded from this link.\nProducers and consumers of explanations in AI The developer who produces the explanation and evaluates it or as Miller et al (2017), the inmates are running the asylum phenomena. But what makes the good explanation for the developer is not necessarily good for other users of the system. The developer has a deeper understanding of the system. He/she might be cursed by his/her knowledge. In addition, However, his/her understanding, perspective, or goals may be different from the end-user. When producing explanations we need to carefully assess the complexity of the explanation and the knowledge and beliefs of the audience. Fred is a simple person and does not know anything about how neural networks work.\nWhat is an explanation? Explanations are always expressed in a contrastive manner and this contrast is usually implied by the context. Also, an explanations is not a description.\nNevertheless, answering \u0026ldquo;what is an explanation? \u0026quot; depends on who we ask.\nPhilosopher care about the normative side of an explanation and consider a (good) explanations to be a scientific explanation. But psychologists are interested in the descriptive side or what people consider as an explanation such as everyday explanations and what makes a good explanation.\nDifferent philosophers and scientists have proposed different definition for an explanation:\nAristotle: Citing the function, the material, the category or the (efficient) cause of X.\nHempel: Producing an (logical) argument whose conclusion is the explanandum X. Salmon: Stating everything that affects the probability of X. In other words, If P(Β|Α) ≠ P(Β) then A is explanatory relevant to B (e.g. P(pregnant | male \u0026amp; contraceptives) = P(pregnant | male)). One downside of this definition is that A does not need to have a high probability to be explanatory. For example,if P(Β|Α) - P(Β) = 0.000001, A is still explanatory relevant to B.\nKitcher: Showing how X fits a more general state of affairs\nSalmon: Stating the causal history of X. An explanation of X will trace the causal processes and interactions that lead to X. But, in general, not all causal events in the past of X are explanatory relevant to X. The causal model presented by Salmon has limitation in dealing with certain type of causation such as Double Prevention. Take the following image where a pink plane wants to drop a bomb on a city. A red plane with an alligator has a mission to shoot the pink plane and prevent the bombing. Also, A blue plane is there to prevent the red plane from shooting the pink plane. Now if the the blue plane successfully shoot the red plane and the pink plane successfully drops its bomb on the city, does the blue plane cause the bombardment of the city.\nTYPES OF EXPLANATIONS Why are we interested in explanations? We seek explanations because:\n To prepare ourselves for similar events in the future : Why is the phone turned off? because it has low battery. Just to explain, understand and assign responsibilities or blames in one-off events: why did the assassination of Duke Ferdinand lead to WWI? To rationalize actions that we take: Why didn't you vote? Because it does not make any difference To find meaning To become satisfied from explanations. The explanations are like orgasms.  Nevertheless, the explanations may not fulfill their function or objective.\nA PREFERENCE FOR TELEOLOGY However, some people and children are often biased toward teleological explanations and they are looking for the purpose not the cause in their explanations: Mountains were created to be climbed.\nExplanations virtues The following properties have been proposed as criteria of a good explanation:\n  No Circularity: \u0026ldquo;This diet pill works because it helps people lose weight\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;People lose weight because they use this diet pill\u0026rdquo; are circular arguments. Although we can detect circularity from childhood, it is not always easy to identify it.\n  Coherence : Different elements of explanation must have internal consistency. It means that an explanation must be consistent with prior knowledge and current evidence.\nHowever, explaining the full set of elements (relations) may not be simple. For instance, to fully explain how a bicycle works we need to say how its various mechanical elements interact and constrain each other.\nExplanations are incomplete (even in science) because our mental representations are skeletal and incomplete. We tend to overestimate the depth of our own understanding. But the moment we start writing down our understanding, it becomes clear that our understanding is (mostly) shallow and incomplete.\nTiger example: Tigers have dark vertical stripes on their bodies but can we tell without looking at an image of a tiger whether these stripes are vertical or horizontal on the tiger's tail and legs?!\nBicycle example: How much do you know how a bicycle work? Draw one!\nBut sometimes compression is also needed.\n We rely heavily in expertise of other minds. In an experiment carried out by Zemla et al. (2017), it was observed that compared to other measures such as complexity, articulation, coherence, generality and truth, one of the most important measures of explanation quality for the participants was “perceived expertise”. Perceived expertise indicates whether participants believed the explanation was written by an expert. The more we we trust in the expertise of the explainer, the more likely we accept the explanation.    Relevance:\n  From philosophical point of view, only factors that make a difference to the explanandum or have a causal role should be included to generate a good explanation. This level of details is ideal but not attainable and we usually find a trade-off by abstraction. Moreover, hyper-concrete explanations are too true to be good (e.g. extremely detailed maps).\n  Strevens (2007) proposed that in order to create an optimal explanation first we need to include every imaginable event and then we remove and abstract every event that makes no difference to the occurrence of the explanandum.\n  But is it true for non-experts? Philosophical view is different from non-expert view. Weisberg et al (2008) showed that adding irrelevant neuroscientific information (e.g. jargons) to an explanation increased its perceived quality by non-experts (naïve adults and neuroscience students).\n  Another experiment was carried out in which participant were asked to rate 3 types of explanations:\n    The average ratings for the abstract explanation was significantly lower than the irrelevant explanation.\n    On the other hand, the causal ratings for the abstract explanation was higher that the other two types of explanations\n      Match the epistemic status of the audience\n When producing explanations we need to carefully asses the knowledge and beliefs of the audience.    Simplicity\n Everyone agrees that explanations should be simple. But what do we mean by simplicity? (number of entities,number of entity types, shortest description? ) Paul Thagard (1989): simplicity is determined by the number of special required assumptions. People prefer these kinds of simpler explanations because fewer assumptions means fewer unexplained causes . However, when probabilities of assumptions are also included in the explanation, people choose the most probable explanation not the simplest. In case of equal probabilities, simpler explanations are preferred. Zemla et al (2017) it showed that the quality of explanations was positively correlated both with the number of unexplained causes and its length (level of detail)    Generality (Breadth– Scope - Coverage)\n Is it better to explain more things but less precisely or fewer things but more precisely? Thagard (1992) argues that an explanations that explains more pieces of evidence should be favored.    EVALUATING EXPLANATIONS To evaluate our explanations, we need to ask a public audience. This audience can be our friends, family members and colleagues who may not have any knowledge of the system. However, we should take into account that the these evaluations can be biased and noisy. For this reason, we need to take a larger sample of people.\nAlternatively, we can also collaborate with HCI experts, psychologist and behavioral scientist to evaluate explanations.\nDifferent groups of users see different explanation and same group of users see different explanation. We need to compare different versions of our explanations (like A/B testing) .\nWe can also utilize online crowdsourcing tools and run our analysis through them:\n •Amazon Mechanical Turk – mturk.co Prolific Academic - prolific.c Gorilla - gorilla.sc Testable - testable.org  What do we need to ask?

What is Data Science?** \u0026ldquo;Data Science\u0026rdquo; is a vague term. One might mean by \u0026ldquo;data science\u0026rdquo;:\n It is the Science of data. This definition is more frequently used by statistician and machine learning and is more theoretical. Doing science with data. This definition is more applied and data intensive. Applying science to data. This definition is also heavily applied and data intensive.  Data is not the New Oil\nSome people are overexcited about having access to huge amount of data as if they have discovered an oil field. Likewise, they believe that they can simply extract value from data and this data is a new driver for progress and prosperity. However, even if we acquire data we cannot be certain that it is valuable and we can extract value from it.\nIn other words, data in and of itself does not present value:\ndata != value but\nBut data and knowledge together can result in value. Here knowledge can be an input or an output of the data.\ndata + knowledge = value\nNow data science can defined as follows:\nIt means that Data Science has three main ingredients:\n Data  Knowledge Value   The kinds of value that Data Science can generate are:\n scientific knowledge and models societal value economic value personal value  2. From Data Mining to Data Science Many consider data mining to be the father of data science. Others say that data mining is a subset of data science. While the interest for data mining is declining, data science gain more popularity.\nFig. 2: Data science is getting more popular than data mining\nFig. 3: CRISP data mining process\nIn data mining, we (implicitly) assume that there is some value in the and our aim is to use data mining techniques to uncover it. We can see data mining just like the extraction of a valuable metals from an existing mine.\nHowever, in data science, we first need to make sure that data has some value. In other words, data science can be seen as prospective, which means we are searching for a mine to extract metal material from it. That puts more emphasis on the exploratory aspect (nature) of data science, which includes the following activities:\nThese activities do not exist in the data mining space and distinguish data science and data mining.\nData Science Trajectory (DST) space\nData mining is a more sequential and more prescriptive approach where every operation must be implemented in a specific order. All activities in data mining can be a part of a data science project but not the opposite. For instance, not every data science project requires a modeling phase. On the other hand, the goal of data science for a specific application can be just data collection or data publication.\nRead more about this in the following paper:\n CRISP-DM Twenty Years Later: From Data Mining Processes to Data Science Trajectories. Fernando Martinez-Plumed, Lidia Contreras-Ochando, Cesar Ferri, Jose Hernandez-Orallo, Meelis Kull, NicolasLachiche, Maria Jose Ramirez-Quintana and Peter Flach. (Under review, 2019)\n 3. Responsible Data Science - The Human Factor (3/5) Data Science is for, about, by and with humans and human factors should be taken into consideration at every stage of a data science project. But it is not always easy to measure, define and ultimately achieve them.\nFor example, look at following table which shows the number and the percentage of students who applied and were admitted to a university.\nAt the first glance, this table might suggest a case of bias toward women in the admission process. However, further examinations show that the low percentage of total admissions for women is due to the fact that female applicants tended to apply to more difficult programs with an overall lower chance of acceptance while men applied to easier programs with a higher probability of acceptance. In other words, the difficulty of programs was a confounding factor that influenced the outcome not gender bias. It indicates measuring a human factor such as fairness is not easy because measuring bias is not easy. Furthermore, according to Goodhart's Law, the moment we decide to use these metrics (e.g. bias) as our target to optimize, they are not good measures anymore.\nin the the rest of talk, Peter Flach discussed the relationship between GDPR and fairness and specifically he touched upon an important issue regarding data ownership and the role of GDPR for personal data protection.\nHe provided an example of authorship to demonstrate that solving data ownership is not a simple task. If someone writes a book about someone else (e.g. Clinton), the author has the ownership and the copyright not the the person whom the book is about.\nResources:\nSlides  Model-Based Machine Learning  This talk was dedicated to Sabine Krolak-Schwerdt who unfortunately passed away recently and was one of the founders of EuADS.\n Three factors have contributed to the popularity and the recent success of AI  More computing power Large amount of available data (Big data) More powerful algorithms  Dozens of machine learning algorithms have been developed.\nBut the \u0026lsquo;No Free Lunch Theorem\u0026rsquo; states that no universal machine learning can solve every problem.\n Averaged over all possible data distributions, every classification algorithm has the same error rate when classifying previously unobserved points. D. Wolpert (1996)\n This means that the goal of machine learning is to find an algorithm that is well-suited to the problem that being solved.\nModel-Based machine learning In the traditional machine learning paradigm, ML algorithms play a centric role. We start by an ML algorithm and we would like to know how we can apply it to our problem.\nHowever, in model-based machine learning paradigm, we are looking to find a well-matched algorithm for our problem. We can derive a model that best represents our problem by making explicit modeling assumptions.\nData and prior knowledge Scenario 1: we have collected a handful of voltage and current measurement from an experiment. and we want to determine the relationship between the current and voltage using these measurements.\nScenario 2: We have a huge database containing images from 1000 objects and our goal is to develop a model to classify each image correctly.\nBut are these datasets \u0026lsquo;big\u0026rsquo; enough for solving their corresponding problems. In the first scenario, although we only have a few measurements, we know that they are enough for finding the relationship between voltage and current. On the other hand, even though we have access to a large number of images for each class, these images do not represent the distribution of all images.\n The trade-off between prior knowledge and the amount of data needed\nTherefore, we must distinguish between two types of \u0026lsquo;big data\u0026rsquo;:\n In terms of size In terms of being statistically significant  Then, Chris Bishop argued that we need to incorporate uncertainties into our machine learning models otherwise the consequences would be dire. It means that we should never ever build direct classifier but we should build probabilistic classifier.\nWhy is that? Because not all misclassification errors are equal and different costs are assigned to different errors. Misclassifying a patient with cancer may be much worse than misclassifying a healthy patient. So, instead of minimizing the number of misclassified instances, we can minimize the expected (average costs).\nFinally, Chris Bishop presented a demo of a movie recommendation system.\nResources:\nSlides\nModel-Based Machine Learning ","date":1577750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577792792,"objectID":"ec240810c875bcfce8efb59e8e36b305","permalink":"/post/2019-12-31-explainable-data-science-summer-school/","publishdate":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-12-31-explainable-data-science-summer-school/","section":"post","summary":"Last September, I had the opportunity to participate in the EXPLAINABLE DATA SCIENCE summer school in Kirchberg, Luxembourg. the summer school was organized by the European Association for Data Science (EuADS) and was held during 10-13 September.\nWhat I specifically liked about this summer school ( of course besides enjoying the the beautiful city of Luxembourg ) was the fact that it covered a vast variety of topics in the explainable machine learning (AI) literature, ranging from visualization, XAI techniques, causality to psychological aspects of explainability.","tags":["XAI","Machine Learning"],"title":"Explainable Data Science Summer School","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R","Tidy Tuesday"],"content":"\rFor 6 years, I had been using python exclusively as the main tool for carrying out my data science tasks and running my experiments.
