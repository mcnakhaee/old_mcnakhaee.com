Shortly before Justice Ginsburg passed, she told her granddaughter, and I quote, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.” End of quote. It wasn’t a personal request. It wasn’t a favor being asked for. It was the last act of a long, unflinching career of standing up for American democracy. Never before in our nation’s history has a Supreme Court justice been nominated and installed while a presidential election is already underway. It defies every precedent, every expectation of a nation where the people, the people, are sovereign and the rule of law reigns.
