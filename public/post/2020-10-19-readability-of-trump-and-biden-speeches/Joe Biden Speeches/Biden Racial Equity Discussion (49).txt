And then when I got elected vice president, one of the press outlets said, “It’s probable no man has ever been assuming the office of vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden.” I hope they weren’t talking intellectual assets. When I got elected when I was 29, I was in Washington before I was sworn in and I got a phone call from my fire department saying my wife and daughter have just been killed. And my two boys were not likely to make it. A tractor trailer broadsided them while they were Christmas shopping. And at the time, my wife’s father, my father-in-law, he came home from World War II and he had owned a restaurant. He was a cook in World War II in the Navy and he ended up opening up a restaurant in a place called Auburn, New York, a town about 20,000 people, just south of Syracuse.
