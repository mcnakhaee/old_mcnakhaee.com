Okay. I’m really good at this. This drives me crazy. Right now, we’re in a situation where if you take a look, there is no national standard for how to open schools, how to open them safely, because the president says, “I have no responsibility. That’s not my response.” I mean, literally, that’s his phrase. “It’s not my responsibility. I’m not the blame for any of this. Let the governors or the mayors take care of it,” and then without the financial help that’s needed to be able to take care of it. I’ve laid out in detail back in July, what we’d have to do to open safely and includes providing the protective PPE, the mask, and other things that are needed, gloves, et cetera, for the schools, the school teachers, and for the children coming to school.
