And for our seniors, social security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made they paid for. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He’s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the social security, without any way of making up for that loss revenue, resulting in cuts. I will not let that happen. If I’m your president, we’re going to protect social security and Medicare. You have my word. One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They’re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice, racial injustice, environmental injustice. I hear their voices, if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it’s the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in your first job, it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone. And I’m not going to have to do it alone because I’ll have a great vice president at my side, Senator Kamala Harris.
