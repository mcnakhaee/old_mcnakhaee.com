One of the most important conversations I’ve had this entire campaign. It was so someone who was much too young to vote. I met with six year old Gianna Floyd the day before her daddy, George Lloyd was laid to rest. She’s an incredibly brave little girl and I’ll never forget it. When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and she said, and I quote, “Daddy changed the world.” Daddy changed the world. Her words burrowed deep into my heart. Maybe George Floyd’s murder was a breaking point. Maybe John Lewis’ passing is the inspiration. But however it’s come to be, however it’s happened, America’s ready in John’s words, to lay down, quote, “The heavy burden of hate at last.” And in the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism. American history tells us that it’s been in our darkest moments that we’ve made our greatest progress, that we found the light. In this dark moment, I believe we’re poised to make great progress again, that we can find the light once more.
