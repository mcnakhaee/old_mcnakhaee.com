I get asked the question all the time by the press that travels with me, although I’m not sure the same ones that are traveling today have asked it, but I get asked the following question. “If in fact you get elected, would you prosecute Trump? Would you pursue prosecuting Trump?” And the answer is I’m not going to pursue prosecuting anybody. I’m going to do what the Justice Department says should be done, should be done and not politicize it. It’s the most dangerous thing that’s happened so far is the politicization of the Department of Justice. It’s become the Department of Trump and that’s wrong.
