We’re going to raise it to $15 an hour nationally. I’ve been deeply involved in raising it as I’ve gone around the country working with cities and counties that in fact have raised it, including New York City and out on the West Coast, as well.

No one in America should be working for a 40-hour week job and still be living in poverty. It should not exist. Number one.
