It’s bizarre, crazy for us. In every single empirical study done, the more money you spend, the better you educate a child throughout the process, the better the community as a whole is. Everybody, across the board. That’s why we also have to make sure that we provide for more direct funding for specific programs in schools. As you know, better than most will know, the bulk of all the funding, if your school uses local funding.
