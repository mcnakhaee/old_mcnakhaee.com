I had the honor of paying respects to Justice Ginsburg and her family. First woman, first woman in history of our nation to lie in state in the US Capitol. And though it should not have taken nearly this long to bestow that honor on a woman, it nevertheless speaks to the unique and powerful impact Justice Ginsburg has made in our society and her enduring legacy of equal rights and equal justice under the law.
