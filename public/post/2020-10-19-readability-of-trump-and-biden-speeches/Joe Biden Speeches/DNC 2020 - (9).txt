And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for eight years as vice president. Let me take this moment to say something we don’t say nearly enough. Thank you, Mr. President, you were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to. No one’s going to say that about the current occupant of the White House. What you know about this president is if he’s given four more years, he’ll be what he’s been for the last four years. The president takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division. He’ll wake up every day believing that job is all about him, never about you. Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children? I see a different America, one that’s generous and strong, selfless, and humble. It’s an America we could rebuild together.
